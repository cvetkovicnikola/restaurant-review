Now, when I drive past, I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don't know why; I just like it better.\n\nThe sweetest ladies run this local bakery, and they always serve with a smile.  It's usually pretty fast too!  And they're CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:\n\nAll of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.\n\nLemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.\n\nThumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!\n\nIs the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "N2DwycuZl95miWf39Yskaw"}

Poor quality work. They put in my new floors prior to painting, then splattered paint all over them, installed the new pipes for my clawfoot tub so close to the wall that I couldn't fit a baseboard behind it, workers smoked inside while doing the work, and never cleaned up after themselves. I walked in once while my bedroom was being painted and they had not washed the walls and were just rolling the paint over dirt and cobwebs. These are just a handful of examples of the issues I have had. At the time of this posting we have now gone almost a month past the contract end date, and it's dragging on. Talk to other contractors in the area and they will let you know this company's reputation. I wish I had. One positive: they stayed within my budget, but at what cost to my sanity and quality of work? I would never use them again. ***Update: June 2016 - They still have not installed the final window they were supposed to. It's a custom window they had to order and according to the window company is still sitting at their warehouse.

Luckily I had also found additional information to refute those articles.  Why lucky, you ask?  Because this is a great little office nestled off the main drag in Dormont.  Yeah, it's a bit of a drive from Pittsburgh proper, but they are also open later to help with the fact that some of us actually work for a living.\n\nIt is a very small waiting room and you really don't want to have to wait due to the different animals that are continually coming through the door -- that is vet common sense -- so make certain you call ahead to get an appointment.  All of the associates were well mannered and fawned over my little Sophie.  All of the paperwork was filled out for us and were were quickly taken back to one of the exam rooms.  Typical exam room with easily cleaned metal table and linoleum floors.\n\nThe Vet-Tech was very knowledgeable and seemed truly interested in making certain my puppy was taken care of.  A little preachy near the end, I let it slide knowing why she was saying it -- positive reinforcement for the puppies is the only way to go people, believe it.  The doctor came in soon after and did the full exam on Sophie.  He was quick and methodical, but at no time did I hear my pup whine.  He pointed out things that he saw and gave Sophie her preliminary vaccinations.  \n\nAnd then all was done.  At no point did he try to up-sell me.  At no point did he or his associates try to give me anything that was not needed.  He was straightforward and plain in his language and he answered all of my questions truthfully.  How do I know?  I already knew the answers to my questions.  I am fairly protective of my Boston Terriers; and as a small breed they have some health idiosyncracies and nuances that many vets don't know about.  He knew the answers.   I was happy.  \n\nAt the end of the visit, they even gave me the records without hesitation.  This office is great.

I had two rats and Dr. Dorn was excellent with both. He was the best vet I could have hoped for. \n\nWith rats, it's sometimes hard to find (even highly experienced) vets who understand that a rat has a personality and bonds with its owner to the same degree as a dog--many people act like pet rats are just large gerbils. Dr. Dorn understood, and never made me feel silly about being anxious about them. He calmed my pets down and they loved him immediately, even falling asleep during the exam. He never tried to up-sell, and when one rat had an operable tumor (a $200 surgery) he didn't make me feel guilty for choosing euthanasia instead (he was a very old rat). When the time came, the entire staff was incredibly patient with me, and let me spend as much time as I needed in the private exam room with my rat. Afterwards, they even sent me a condolence card. \n\nThe vet techs were all professional and cheerful. The small office seemed like a friendly, casual environment. Exams for a rat were around $60 with medicine and so forth... I can't remember the specific prices, but they seemed reasonable. They were always able to see me on the same day I called.

Going to the right vet's office can really help with that anxiety, and for my family and I this animal hospital is the perfect place to take our beloved pets.\n\nMy family has taken our pets to this practice as far back as I can remember. While the team here hasn't cared for our house's entire little zoo over the years (which has seen everything from crabs to frogs to guinea pigs and more), they have helped us take care of our old rabbit and two cats. And I have to say the staff have never disappointed. Most recently they've often accommodated my family at the last minute when our cats took a sudden downhill turn, and when we come in they handle our pets wonderfully and kindly. One staff member once even asked for my permission before they brought in their interns and trainees to see my cat, who has a rare scar formation in her eye; given the stress that can surround a vet visit it meant a lot to me that this person checked with me before she used my cat as a teaching vehicle, rather than simply dragging their entire staff in to stare at my poor kitty.\n\nI know that some of their services can be a little pricier (surgeries in particular can seem a bit high if you've ever gotten estimates from shelters for the same procedures), but given their status as a local independent group I understand why this is the case. And on another important note, I strongly advise fellow pet owners to bring their animals either in crates or with proper leashes, restraints, etc. as needed, as this office does have a small wait room and that means it's super important for all owners to both have control over and to protect the animals they bring to this office. That said, I've never had a problem with my two kitties, my old rabbit, or any other owners' animals to date.\n\nI absolutely recommend this vet's office to other pet owners. Its location is excellent for people like me (even if its parking lot is a little small), and its fantastic staff have never disappointed and have always done what's right for my beloved pets. I admittedly hope that I don't need to be back any time soon, but it's good to know that this place is here and can provide the top-top service they do when I and my dear pets need their help.", "type": "review", "business_id": "titJ-ofqKMG9d0i9_kkX6A"}

For those who are metaphysically geared, this means you can pick out your stones by whether you are a Pisces, Aries, Sagittarius, etc. Though I didn't realize it at first, when I did, it was really, really helpful in helping me pick out the stone I wanted. \n\nLots of beautiful crystal jewelry pieces and unusual stones. You go to most shops and they don't have half of the selection Moonstones does. Had something called Maw sit sit, which, being an avid crystal hunter, I'd never seen that before and was totally surprised about. \n\nThey also have a great selection of jewelry pieces for Wicca path, Goddess symbolism, and other Earth-based followings, which you don't usually see. \n\nCrystal gridders! For a metaphysical store, the amount and diversity of small grid style stones was great. If I had a local client who was looking for crystals to grid their home, I'd suggest Moonstones. Picking out crystals online is difficult and oft, disappointing - so it's best to pick them out in person. This is a great place if you are looking to grid something. \n\nI bought a beautiful pendant while there and got a cool book as well. Overall A+ in 'stuff they have.' \n\nIn the end, shoplifting fears of the owner aside - the stones were great and I got a cool book. \n\nI wish Moonstones all the best in their business and the abundance that may come!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wnn1GtvvtnkFdPfdRcYW-Q"}

Seriously, after having to survive on Foodland, the only \"neighborhood\" grocery store in Mt. Washington, this is a welcome change.

It's clean, has most everything I need and it's at the right price. I'm actually surprised how much variety they offer in such a \"small\" space. Small being the operative word, considering most Giant Eagle's are ginormous. \n\nI've even discovered new products here, like my delicious Lara Fiber Bars. I'm surprised at the nice gourmet cheese selection, the big deli area and even a counter for fresh seafood. So now I can just run down the block if I need to pick up something quick or do my whole week's shopping here. It's glorious! \n\nThe only thing I wish for is a better parking lot. Since I'm coming off Dwight Ave it's nice to sneak right in. But coming out is another issue. There's only one way traffic around the parking lot. So you're usually stuck waiting behind cars trying to park and pull out. This is very minor though... just an impatient person talking here.\n\nThe main point.. it's WAY cheaper than Giant Eagle!

My family and I tend to shop at Giant Eagle, partly because of the large size of their stores and partly because of their GetGo rewards. Kuhn's has somehow become the place we stop when we don't have time to drive to Giant Eagle. \n\nWhich is totally a shame, because whenever I DO stop in here I'm reminded about how nice the place actually is. Today a simple trip for milk turned into a fall-themed decoration shopping spree that went really well (yay super cute owl pillows!) and I ended up picking some breakfast and lunch items as well just because of how cheap they were. I know from past experience that the produce is fresh, and between the wonderful aroma and colorful display the bakery here is absolutely torturous to pass. There's also a ready-made dinner/lunch shelf with sandwiches, chicken wings, pizzas and a few dessert items if you want to grab those on your way out; I've actually gotten dinner here a few times on my way home from the city when I was too tired to cook. What's not to like about affordable and delicious food, right?\n\nHowever, there is at least one thing that does keep me from wanting to be a regular here and giving Kuhn's a 5 star review: the blasted parking lot you have to deal with to go here, which I've cursed in other reviews. This lot is the one that fills up super quickly, creates miniature traffic jams like no one's business, and is a time-stealing trap. Sigh. Suddenly I think I understand why my family always goes to Giant Eagle.\n\nSorry, Kuhn's. Your prices are wonderful, your set-up fantastic, and your options well varied and impressive.

For starters, it's a practical size. I don't need to walk halfway around the planet, or use GPS, to find what I need. The staff are ALWAYS helpful and friendly! Despite their modest size, they do stock a very wide range of products, meats, and produce-far more than any other grocery store of similar size. Also, Kuhn's started as a butcher shop waaaay back in the day, and the quality  and selection of their meats shows it-far better than any competitors. They are open 24 hours, and the deli is open til 10pm. The hot foods here are fantastic. I often just grab my dinner to go, while I'm shopping. And the rotisserie chickens are HUGE compared to other stores. I just wish the hot foods were open a bit longer-they shut down, and 6pm, when most people are just getting home from work. The baked goods are another plus. The cakes here actually taste like cake from a bakery. Not many grocery stores can make such a claim. Checking out at Kuhn's is also a breeze. They actually have plenty of staff on registers, so as to keep lines moving, and very short-unlike S&S and Big Bird. And there are none of those damned self check outs. If I'm giving a store my business, I shouldn't have to check myself out, because they are too cheap to properly staff the place (I'm talking to YOU Giant Eagle). In addition, the prices here typically LOWER than S&S and Big Bird. The only reason I can't give this place a full 5 stars, is that they often run out of basic products (dog food, deli meats, sale items), the early closing of hot foods, and the game of chicken one has to play when parking at Banksville Plaza.

I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)\n\nI have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with \"yinzers\" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. \n\nWe have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a \"U\" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. \n\nThis is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the \"full\" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and \"tanned\" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) \n\nMy dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to \"hangry\" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).\n\nYes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don't let me down, The Huddle.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wan0X-oHpLgGTPXqaICZCw"}

The result are wings with crispy, sticky skin and tender, juicy meat. \n\nThe Huddle isn't trying to be fancy or unique. They are serving straight up bar food, but it's pretty good bar food. Also, don't expect 5 star service (but the wings make up for it).\n\nAside from the wings, I'm a huge fan of their Reuben and their monstrous grilled cheese. Pizza is surprisingly good as well! We usually have a party of 6 on wing night and their pizza is the perfect appetizer to split among the table.\n\nCash only!", "type": "review", "business_id": "wan0X-oHpLgGTPXqaICZCw"}

I even made an appointment with someone totally unknown - no yelp reviews, no word of mouth approval, no bio on the website, no nothing!  That's right y'all I can be spontaneous.   Good thing I only had highlights & a trim planned...and lucky me, it was fantastic.\n\nYou can tell that the space has fairly recently transitioned from down-home barbershop to classy salon (due to a change of ownership from father to son, apparently).  All of the staff seemed uniformly very young and very hip, but still friendly and accommodating.  The music was all 90s and 2000s pop and alternative throwbacks that were such a delight.  And my mystery hairstylist was awesome - Dave not only gave me a really great cut and the most thorough highlighting of my life, but he also charmed my pants off - just a genuine, friendly, interesting fellow.\n\nI highly recommend this little gem - and if you've never been to Dormont, here's your chance!

You can't even get a deal like that at the crappy chain salons!\n\nAlso, I was really excited to try the salon after reading that Sergio himself had trained under the talented Robert Cromeans!! The best salon experience I had ever had was at his ARCS salon in Las Vegas, so I had high hopes.\n\nI arrived for my haircut probably a half an hour early. Surprisingly even though they were super packed ( I was there at 6:30) they were able to take me right back. My Stylist was Richie and he was extremely personable.\n\nThe salon itself is by far one of the best I've seen in Pittsburgh. All of the stylists were busy with clients and the energy of the place was great. Also great music added so much to the atmosphere.\n\nDuring my consultation Richie listend to EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING I wanted. I think that's the most important part about being a hairstylist is being able to listen. Needless to say my haircut came out amazing. He took a good chunk of time with me, which was great because I hate feeling rushed in and out of a salon. Not too mention that he gave me the most thorough blowout of my life! \n\nFeeling very welcomed, heard, and appreciated at a salon makes the entire experience so much better than \"Just getting your hair done\".\nIn the end I am very excited to enjoy my next haircut here in October.

I have great confidence in my new choice of stylist and will definitely return and look nowhere else.

There's parking in the back (which I was not aware since I'm new back to the burgh and directionally challenged! ) but Sergio was kind enough to provide his own quarters and sent a staff member actually out to add more quarters to my meter, and another clients that was in there as well...

A few months back, after reading great reviews of her work, I went to her for a haircut. I was very pleased, so I went back for highlights and a trim. This time around I am extremely upset. Karen left the color on my hair way too long. And my request for a trimming of my ends turned into very short layers in the front going back past my ears and long in the back. Think Carol Brady of the Brady Bunch. She also thinned my hair out, which I absolutely hate because my hair is already very thin. Now I have frizzy, uneven ends that stick out at all different lenghts. There are also bleed marks of color noticeable in the hair line. The worst of it is the damage caused by being over processed. I have severe breakage everywhere especially at the top. I now have a ton of hairs sticking up at the top of my head and my hair over all looks frizzy and fried. It continues to break. I went and showed Sergio the owner who laughed when he saw it saying it was new hair growth, not breakage. Even after I explained that it was not like that until after my hair was done at his salon he stuck to his guns. I would like to say that I am only disappointed by what's happened. But I am very upset. Every girl knows what it feels like to have a bad experience at the salon.

I know how to care for them and am willing to pay for the upkeep, as they make my life easier.  I had a gifted Groupon--which I'm always leery about the service you get with Groupons--but I figured this place had great reviews (for hair, mostly) and had good hours for my work schedule. My appointment about 2 weeks from my call and I showed up 10 minutes early for an appointment on the hour. We got started about 10 minutes after the hour, no biggie.  I thought the appointment finished very quickly, though I wasn't sure if I'd fallen asleep after such a long silence and a very warm room.  I was deposited at the counter after being told to come back in 4 weeks (though she told me, \"I usually tell my clients to come back in 3 weeks, but you can come back in 4). My understanding of an initial natural lash application takes about 1.5-2 hours, and I didn't see anything in Sergio's descriptions that made me think differently. I was done in about 50 minutes, which I'm certain of this based on when I silenced an incoming call at the start of the appt to when I sent a text after getting back to my car. Within 2-2.5 weeks, all the lashes had fallen off, without my lash attached.  No oil-based cleanser, no water for the first 24-48 hours, and I avoid getting shampoo in my eyes when I wash my hair.  I called an let them know and they were super responsive.  The person who did my lashes was no longer there, and the woman who replaced her was great.  They gave me another initial set in the place of my 3-4 week fill that was included in my Groupon. I was asked what I was going for, and I answered \"natural..maybe a little more volume, but not over the top\".  This application took 1.5 hours and it passed quickly.  When I saw them, I was a bit surprised, because they were.....too much for me, much more than I've had in the past. I mentioned it to her that it was a little much, and she assured me it was a natural set.  I was a little leery, but thought that since it was a change, I needed to adjust to it.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen. My husband, who always tries to make me feel good, gave me honest feedback that they looked unlike any lashes I've ever had...and that it wasn't a good look.  That was supported by numerous other comments throughout the next day at work.  Within 24 hours, I had them removed (not at Sergio's) because they weren't felt to be \"professional looking\". I don't really fault Sergio's, as I should have not left there as hesitant as I was, knowing I've never had such obvious extensions before.  That, and I was already tired after a long work day and wanted to be home.   I do appreciate that they were super responsive when I had the initial problem, and would tell others to make sure to speak up.  I'm sure if I called and let them know, they would do whatever was in their power to fix it, but, at this point, my lashes are much shorter and sparser before I had gone in, so I think I'm going to cool it on the extensions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "05l84gPaZX2IWaIaoAq3hg"}

This and Little Tokyo are, to my knowledge, the only sushi restaurants in Mt. Lebanon.\n\nSushi Three has an extensive menu that seems to have expanded since the last time I visited, and has lots more than just sushi.  There is a long list of appetizers, tempuras and teriyaki dishes, and some Chinese offerings.  The main focus, the sushi, takes up a large portion of the menu, and there are many different rolls, ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg and caviar).  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the vegetable sushi platter, which I have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  There is even a separate vegetarian menu.\n\nWhile I do appreciate the wide-ranging menu, I just can't like the atmosphere.  It's always very quiet and dark inside, and I always get the feeling of being in a cave.  I prefer to get take-out or delivery.\n\nOverall, I prefer Little Tokyo, but with Sushi Three's improved menu and large number of vegetarian options, my rating may change soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QnyzlVMyx0Exri-Lay10cA"}

We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was \"Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.\" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down.

They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.\n\nSpeaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I dislike eating in the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh to date (although with more and more places opening this opinion may change soon!). If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.\n\nBy the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes (one family member of mine absolutely adores their pork katsudon). But of course, a place with the word \"sushi\" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy. My personal routine order as of today is a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I need to be reeeally hungry to eat all of any other order I make. \n\nBut hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QnyzlVMyx0Exri-Lay10cA"}

I've had much better \"fast food\" style Chinese food in more rural areas, so I felt disappointed by the lackluster performance of the meal.\n\nThe Good: The fried dumplings were amazing and while the wonton soup was strangely missing its green onions, it was still tasty. Actually, I'm thinking of always having my dumplings fried from now on like potstickers, because it really made my night.\n\nThe Bad: I ordered the classic General Tso's to get a good range of what they offered and Moo Goo Gai Pan, which is chicken and veggies in a white sauce (one of my favorite Chinese dishes). The food was...just ok. The General Tso's sauce was a bit too red in color but it was crispy like it should be and it tasted fine. The white sauce dish was sort of...off. I can't even explain it, but a couple of bites in I started hating the taste. The veggies were cooked well, but the chicken wasn't of a very high quality and my taste buds got turned off by the whole dish. These are classic dishes and if you can't get them right that worries me. My meal started going downhill around there.\n\nThe Ugly: I ordered both fried and steamed rice (again to get a good sampling), and the fried rice was bad. It was too brown, not really fried (just limp), and very sparse with a few carrots and peas and no scrambled egg bits (not de rigueur for delivery Chinese but I do love when fried rice has that in it). I'm not sure what happened - did they use new rice, or wet rice, or cooked it too long? Whatever it was, it was horrible. I might try to refry it tomorrow, but if it is still bad I'll probably just have to pitch it. \n\nThe price for all of this was about the same for what I've paid for Chinese meals at restaurants and delivery places that I consider to be a little more \"upscale.\" So I didn't think I was saving any money, and I was getting less quality for my troubles. There are several Asian places in the area that make great food, so I don't feel like I need to limit myself to this one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "81sqVj0xHyJXGYT0ip5fmQ"}

Keep in mind that the entire experience below took less than five minutes...\n\nI recently had a consultation with Dr. Karnavas for a new retainer. My mouth is very small and my bite is very tight, so I am unable to use standard impression trays to have molds made of my teeth. (I know this after visiting King Orthodontics earlier in the year and having no luck with even his smallest/pediatric trays.) Therefore, before I went to Karnavas' office, I purchased a bunch of foam fluoride trays that dentists use for her to JUST TRY. I understood they might not work, but I figured there was no harm in trying. Apparently, Karnavas DOES NOT POSSESS THE ABILITY TO TRY and help her patients NOR DOES SHE POSSESS ANY PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS WHATSOEVER.\n\nUpon entering the exam room, I explained to Karnavas my situation, and, before even seeing the foam trays, she immediately told me they wouldn't work because they were too shallow. A valid point had she maybe LOOKED AT THE TRAYS or LOOKED IN MY MOUTH at all. Oh, did I forget to mention that she DID NOT ONCE ASK TO EXAMINE MY TEETH? NOT ONCE did she expresses ANY interest in examining my mouth, which was SHOCKING since King Orthodontics had done a full consult with me that included an exam, photos, X-rays, etc. (BTW, the people at King are fantastic; I just didn't have foam trays back when I saw them.) \n\nRepeatedly I tried to explain that conventional impression trays wouldn't fit into my very small mouth and asked if we could please just TRY the foam tray? No. SHE REFUSED. \n\nI then asked what she suggested that I do, and she told me that it was \"up to me.\" \"Up to me\" except that she repeatedly negated my idea of what I wanted to try. WHAT KIND OF PROFESSIONAL leaves diagnosis and problem-solving up to the PATIENT?! A COMPLETELY CLUELESS ONE, that's what kind. I even asked to see her smallest impression tray, but she skirted around that as well and I never did get to see any of her equipment. \n\nFinally I became so exasperated that I told her it didn't make sense for me to waste her supplies and time (because CLEARLY I WAS WASTING HER TIME) trying to do something that's been proven not to work. She simply said \"OK\" and walked out of the room.\n\nOne final thing that I thought was really odd and extremely uninviting: Karnavas kept her mask on the entire meeting. Meaning, I NEVER saw her full face. She had it on when she entered the room, when I introduced myself to her (SHE DID NOT INTRODUCE HERSELF), and when she was talking to me. STRANGE, considering (again) that SHE NEVER EXAMINED MY MOUTH. \n\nSo, to recap:\n- Lacks problem-solving skills and the ability to try\n- Clueless\n- Lazy\n- Extremely impersonal and uninviting\n\nOr maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's just disinterested in helping 30-year-old women in wheelchairs that offer to pay out of pocket.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3FUUb4SjXJc5BkZr2Jpgdg"}
