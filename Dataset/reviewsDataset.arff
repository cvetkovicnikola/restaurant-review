'Mr Hoagie is an institution. Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.', positive, 0, 0
'Excellent food. Superb customer service. I miss the mario machines they used to have, but it\'s still a great place steeped in tradition.', positive, 0, 0
'Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.', positive, 1, 0
'First the only reason this place could possibly win best hoagie is because there\'s no competition. Two hoagies and a side of onion rings cost $25.74\n\nSo I\'m thinking with the reader choice awards and $10 per 12\" hoagie these will be awesome. \n\nI was sadly mistaken. \n\nThe only reason I didn\'t give one star is because is the bread & dressing is fairly decent. \n\nSo on to the hoagies, the Italian is general run of the mill. Minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce. You get more meat at subway. Nothing really special & NOT worthy of the $10 price tag. \n\nSecond, the steak hoagie, it is atrocious. \nNo cheese?!?!? You have to add cheese for $1 so now the steak hoagie is $11. That has so little amounts of meat that I thought I was eating a lettuce & onion hoagie. I am thoroughly disappointed with this hoagie, possibly the worst value of a hoagie I\'ve ever eaten. \nI\'m not say eating at subway is any better, but for the huge price difference you are better off doing so. \nCheck out pasquales down the road, better hoagie & price.', negative, 1, 0
'Normally, I do not do reviews of an establishment unless the rating is exceptionally great or exceptionally bad.  If I had not felt sucker punched and mugged after I left Mr. Hoagie, I would not be writing this bad review.  On my first and last trip there, I paid $24.59 for two whole hoagies.  \n\n1) The Italian (ordered because the woman (she) working there told me it was their most popular hoagie) I ordered with lettuce and onions (no tomato, italian dressing which all come free with the hoagie).  I had to pay $1 to add cheese to the hoagie.  Because I was traveling and would not be eating the hoagie right away, I asked for the italian on the side.  She told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side.  I passed on that on principle.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved her money by declining the tomato.  I was not going to pay for the dressing on the side.  At this point, I am certain something is not right and this place appears to me to be in financial trouble.  That pales in comparison to what happened next.  I opened the hoagie and there were three microscopically thin slices of meat on this hoagie.  Ham, salami, and bologna.  Bologna!?!?!?!?    Who in the hell puts disgusting bologna on an Italian hoagie?  That disqualifies that hoagie as an Italian.  The red flags indicating this place is in financial trouble are blinding my view.  One area of this hoagie only had one slice of bologna, no ham and no salami.\n\n2)  The Steak hoagie came with nothing on it but lettuce, tomato, onions, and dressing.  I ordered it without lettuce, tomato, onions, or dressing.  I asked for mayo on the side.  I had to pay for that so I declined.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved them money by passing on the lettuce, tomato, fresh onions, and dressing!  I paid $3 to add sautéed mushrooms, onions, and cheese.  Here we go again.  Canned mushrooms that were not even cooked through (were still cold) and onions that were still crunchy/undercooked.  News flash:  you need to serve fresh mushrooms that have been sautéed (canned mushrooms are another sign this place is in financial trouble).  I literally had to open the hoagie to find the steak because I could not taste or see it.  The hoagie was 50\% mushrooms, 30\%onions, 10\% cheese and 10\% steak.\n\nI could have personally made 10 whole hoagies with substantial quality ingredients and toppings for the $24.59 I paid for these two whole hoagies.  I intentionally patronize non-chain restaurants to support small businesses.  In this case, Never. Again.  (The hoagie bun was better than average.)  Wake up or you are going to lose your business.', negative, 0, 0
'I like this place a lot. It\'s a good toasted hoagie.\n\nI actually don\'t like a my bun exploding with meat, but as a previous poster mentioned if you do maybe you wouldn\'t like this place.\n\nThe inside badly needs updated though. \n\nThe staff is friendly.', positive, 0, 0
'All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The \"Wet Cajun\" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!\n\nThe dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer\'s dream!!  \"Pittsburgh Dad\" would love this place n\'at!!', positive, 0, 0
'Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.', negative, 0, 0
'Cold cheap beer. Good bar food. Good service. \n\nLooking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go. The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries. \n\nGood grilled chicken salads or steak.  Soup of day is homemade and lots of specials. Great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer.', positive, 0, 0
'Possibly the most overhyped establishment in Allegheny County. If you\'re not a regular, you will be ignored by those who\'re tending bar. Beer selection is okay, the prices are good and the service is terrible. I would go here, but only if it was someone else\'s idea.', negative, 0, 0
'Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don\'t think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene\'s house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let\'s talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn\'t sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\n\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.', negative, 1, 0
'This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don\'t plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be.', negative, 0, 0
'Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it\'s just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nIt\'s a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally\'s in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. \n\nThe guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I\'ve come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. \n\nA big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I\'ve been to and the first I\'ve seen of that sort of nickel and diming....\n\nPrice for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again.', positive, 0, 0
'I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can\'t wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you\'ll see on a newer course.  Can\'t wait to experience it!', positive, 0, 0
'This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak\'s \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he\'s usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I\'m pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.', positive, 5, 0

'This place should have a lot more reviews - but I\'m glad it doesn\'t, they don\'t need to get any busier.\n\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you\'re all about ambiance, don\'t bother. If you pretend you\'re in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you\'re happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \n\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\n\n-Fish Sandwiich\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\n-Flounder\n-Shrimp a few ways (\"Norfolk\" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\n-Hawkins St Special\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\n\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I\'m not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don\'t want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.', positive, 3, 1
'This place was very good. I found out about Emil\'s when watching a show called \"25 Things I Love About Pittsburgh\" on WQED hosted by Rick Seback. This place ain\'t a luxurious restaurant...it\'s a beer & a shot bar / lounge. But the people are friendly & the food is good. I had the fish sandwich which was great. It ain\'t in a great part of town, Rankin, but I\'ve been in worse places!! Try this place.', positive, 1, 0
'Old school.....traditional \"mom \'n pop\" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you\'ll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it.', positive, 0, 0
'Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Seback\nack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She\'s very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty.', positive, 2, 1

'After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil\'s after he\'d seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I\'m kind of addicted to late 40\'s and early 50\'s, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn\'t involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that\'s like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn\'t hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply \'Emil\'s. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn\'t want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say \'Reaaaaaalllly?\'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can\'t afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said \'Yeah, it\'s huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain\'t that nuts?\' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil\'s is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950\'s. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh\'s seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I\'ve yet to have in da burgh.', positive, 3, 2
'This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn\'t decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I\'m glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back.', positive, 0, 0
'From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven\'t seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn\'t until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world\'s coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I\'ve had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It\'s in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that\'s not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.', positive, 1, 4
'Another divey place we have been going to for years. My dad\'s favorite, as he knows the original owners. Certain items on the menu are named after the kids. Huge portions, might have a bit of a wait some nights. Huge burgers, fish sandwiches, salads. Decent service.', positive, 0, 0
'Love my hometown favorites. Cannot beat their fish sandwiches (although I do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced bread...stop that). Always will support Emil\'s\nOther favorites include Reuben, Hawkins Avenue sandwich, Chrissy Club.', positive, 0, 0
'Emil\'s is a great place to eat! The prices are VERY reasonable, the portions are HUGE and everything I have ever ordered has been tasty and well prepared. The people who work there are so friendly, as are the customers who eat there. Ample free parking makes it easy to go there. I didn\'t worry about the area- the police station is right across the street. Don\'t leave the Burgh without having (1) their fish sandwich, and (2) their Reuben. You will be glad you ate there!', positive, 0, 0
'I love everything about this place. The food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love that there are no windows -- it\'s its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. Lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can\'t be manufactured. It takes decades of good food and good vibes.\n\nAlso, the food is really good. :)', positive, 0, 0
'I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil\'s lounge as WQED\'s Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  \n\nThe place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don\'t be put off at first - the outside doesn\'t have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn\'t... And thank god for that.\n\nThe place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we\'re not here for the Decor - we\'re here for some dinner.  \n\nThe menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I\'m cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini\'s Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil\'s uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren\'t skimpy with the bacon.\n\nThe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.\n\nOverall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It\'s one of the few places (Big Jim\'s in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  Please go.', positive, 1, 1
'We have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good food and friendly staff. Vwey reasonably priced and large portions. The owner, Chrissy has taken what Emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. Favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!', positive, 0, 0
'We had gone to the Frick Mansion for a tour and I told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in Rankin. There wasn\'t much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  We stopped in front and my wife said we aren\'t going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. Don\'t forget the liver and onions.', positive, 0, 0
'Excellent fish sandwich, Wonderful Reuben Sandwich, even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade.   Chrissy \nIs a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome.  Restaurant personnel are pleasant.   I really enjoy visiting Emils when I\'m in town   My only regret is that they are closed Mondays.   Worth the trip', positive, 0, 0
'This is my fourth time but my first review. It never disappoints! Always home cooking, old school like grandma\'s house. Don\'t expect ambiance, but if you\'re hungry and want nice wait staff, (usually family) squeaky clean, great value and generous portions-way more than I can ever finish, Emil\'s is your place.\n\nTonight I had a cup of the chicken dumpling soup that was sooooo good! Very obviously home made. I had a side of onion rings that were perfectly cooked, which doesn\'t sound fancy, but I still couldn\'t finish. My husband had the chicken parm. Thursday is Italian night. It came with a huge salad, very fresh, an entire loaf of Italian bread, and a generous portion of nicely crisped and tender chicken breasts. Added to that, a side helping of ziti. My husband enjoyed it very much, the chicken was perfectly cooked. I\'m a sauce snob, Italian, allergic to with an aversion to green peppers. To me, there was just a hint of green pepper in the sauce so I probably would avoid anything with red sauce at Emil\'s but that\'s just my quirk. I\'ve had the stuffed cabbages there, the fried fish, Ruebens, burgers - all wonderful! Emil was and his family is of Serbian decent. Food is love. We love Emils!', positive, 0, 0

'Great food  & service every visit. They do so many things right there especially taking care of the customers.

I\'m glad Emil\'s has not.', positive, 0, 0
'This is our second time here in two weeks.  We have always liked Emil\'s, but just haven\'t been out this way lately.  This is now going to change.  Last week we had the wonderful fish - it has always been good.  Last week we stopped on a Tuesday after golf.  The bartender recommended the special of the day - the Chicken Romano with garlic and olive oil pasta.  It was truly outstanding!  I can\'t wait to go back and have it again!  The homemade Tomato soup with Asiago cheese was delicious as well.  Thanks Chef Tony!', positive, 0, 0

'I like this course. It\'s always very well maintained. The carts are in excellent shape, all electric and all equipped with GPS. The greens fees are extremely reasonable and many of the holes are challenging, even if you are a better golfer. It truly has a grand view up and down the Mon, from the Triangle and the Cathedral of Learning to Braddock, the Edgar Thompson Works, Kennywood and beyond. Yet, when you go a few more feet on the cart path, you are in the woods, alone with the abundant wildlife. One caveat- bring an abundant supply of balls. If you golf like I do, one sleeve will not be enough!', positive, 0, 0
'2nd time playing here. Was in the area for a bowling tournament so a group of us decided to come early and get a round of golf in. The course is hilly and challenging with readable and fairly flat greens. But, as the name suggests, what a Grand View of both the course as well as the surrounding areas. \nCarts are in excellent shape and provide you with electronic scoring and course GPS.  The folks here take pride in their course and take very good care of it.', positive, 0, 0
'Challenging but fun course! Bring plenty of extra balls, I am a novice and lost at least 5. Carts are in great condition and remind you to stay on the cart path (sometimes annoying when looking for balls but safety first) and guide you to the next hole. The pro was very nice and patient with our group as we had to delay teeing off for an hour due to parkway closures. Driving range is nothing to write home about but gets the job done for warming up. Beautiful views and lots of variety of length and layout of holes. I\'ll definitely be back!', positive, 0, 0
'This would be my local haunt, if I were ever to relocate to the Pittsburgh area. What a great little place! Such friendly staff, and some damn good eats!\n \nIt was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game. \n\nThey have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I\'m sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can\'t remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.\n\nGoing back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n\' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.\n\nThe other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. I really, really wanted his SPAM t-shirt.', positive, 2, 2
'A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn\'t disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I\'m guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \n\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\n\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren\'t canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I\'ve ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\n\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I\'ll never know.', positive, 0, 1
'Alexion\'s has been around forever.  The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn\'t know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti\'s, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion\'s is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.

'Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.

'I got \'new\' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \nI took the tire over to Flynn\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\'d give me a new tire \"this time\". \nI will never go back to Flynn\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!', negative, 1, 0

Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry.

'Most random location for a mini golf course ever.  This is old school. It\'s built into the woods (spray yourself for bugs first) right off Forsythe Rd near Carnegie Park.

'This quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest, yet most original and fun locations that I have yet visited.  Coming from Texas, it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody Pennsylvanian terrain. It can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce.  The cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play.  Improvements were being made and I will look forward to returning on my next visit to the Pittsburgh area.  I enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why I didn\'t give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par.', positive, 0, 0

'Don\'t waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing.', negative, 1, 0
'I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I\'ll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere\'s where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they\'re waiting for the permit, but they\'ll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they\'re digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn\'t informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\" Well, that didn\'t happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn\'t need access to my house changes to they\'re drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn\'t cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn\'t use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn\'t it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn\'t happen here.\n\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It\'s not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.', negative, 10, 1
'When I wanted a deck for the back of my home I ended up calling Quaker State Construction. It ended up working very well and they were very polite. I got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck.

I now have a beautiful deck that I can relax and that my family can enjoy. Overall, they did a good job and I would use them in the future for all my deck necessities.', positive, 0, 0
'Our cat went out the other night and must have gotn into a fight. He was wounded but we could not tell the extent of his injuries. My girlfriend called them today and they made an appt for us immediately.  When we got there, I couldn\'t believe how friendly and caring they all were. We went into the exam room with doctor Tierney Kelley and a vet asst Sam. They were the best. So gentle and caring. They did not pressure us into any procedures that my cat did not need. They worked hard So we didn\'t have to leave him over night. This was by far the best veterinarian I have gone to in all my years as a pet owner. This has all become a racket for making money. Doctors don\'t care about the animals in 90\% of the places you go, but Greetree animal clinic is not one of those places.

'I cannot praise this place enough. I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:\n* They do not over charge\n* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way\n* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays\n* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. \n* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I\'ve ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal. \n\nThankyou Greentree Animal Clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all Veterinary Care Facilities.', positive, 0, 0

'Three months ago I brought my 13 yr old golden retriever to this clinic for an ear problem. It was diagnosed and treated.  Shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like.  I watched her for a couple hours do this and then called the vet to see if maybe she was having an allergic reaction to the medicine they gave her.  She was very uncomfortable.  I asked if they though she needed to come back to the office.  The dr told me that it sounded like she was overheated and to put cold towels on her.  I told him that I didn\'t think that was the problem because she hadn\'t been out.  At this point they were open and would be for another hour.   Two hours later I was at a vet hospital with them telling me she is suffering from a heart problem and that they really couldn\'t do anything for her.  WHAT?!?!  So I found myself having to put her down.  Fast forward to now.  I have a 14 wk puppy that has blood in its stool. They have not seen her yet. I bring in a sample.  Wait 24 hrs.  They leave a message that it\'s positive and to call for an appt.  I call. She has to wait 4 days to be seen.  WHAT?!?!?   Obviously my pups are out of there for good!

'Ive pretty much been eating at various Kings\' pretty regularly since I was a child when my parents would take my sister and I into the Fox Chapel location often.  Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location. I love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. \n\nService is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.\n\nIm in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.

'I arrived around 10 am on a Saturday morning.  I was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and I informed her that I was alone.  She had just arrived, as well, and wasn\'t exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.\n\nThe waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh\'s own Jenny Lee® Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.

'Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. \'Rocky\' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their \'raved about\' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn\'t great, but they swore it was because they\'d run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn\'t great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that \'blue collar bar\' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to \'ask\', and the child honestly had no clue what \'white meat\' and \'dark meat\' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn\'t answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler \'Tell him I\'ll fix him up\'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you\'d find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she\'d expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn\'t know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area.

'This is a great little gem!  On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky\'s.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!

'Stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the \'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it\'s best, it\'s like a floor show with the actor\'s backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don\'t forget the italian toast.\n\nFrequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don\'t think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee\'s good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don\'t get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy.', positive, 0, 0
'The biggest breakfast in Pittsburgh, as far as I can tell - and delicious and cheap too. I ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. Oh, and a side of toast. For under $5, if I recall.\n\nHUGE portions, all well-executed; as good as DeLuca\'s.\n\nI\'ve not had anything besides breakfast, so can\'t comment on the burger or anything else.\n\nCramped quarters, and you\'ll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination.', positive, 0, 0
'Okay, let\'s first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have \"dippy\" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a \"dippy\" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!', positive, 1, 0
'I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did.', positive, 0, 0
'I\'ve lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I\'ve found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you\'ll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. \n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.\n-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)\n-Cash only\n-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you\'re a lumberjack\n-About those homefries: They\'re often undercooked. I\'ve had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.\n-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo', positive, 2, 1

Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci\'s?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini\'s bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  \n\nHave had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!\n\nLunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.\n\nGets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.\n\nRemember it is a diner.  Don\'t expect fancy decor.', positive, 1, 1

'BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We\'ve been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.', positive, 0, 0

'Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That\'s because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I\'ve ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.\n\nI easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can\'t imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \n\nWhen my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I\'d barely started.  The sausage was great, just don\'t ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \n\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.\n\nA few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won\'t feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You\'ll be glad you did!', positive, 4, 2
'Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can\'t hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.\n\nWhat\'s the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.\n\nOnly bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I\'ll never be able to get in.', positive, 3, 2
'Yum - freaking - me!\n\nAs the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:\n\n- Don\'t eat early in the week \n- I don\'t recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave\n\n\n I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.\n\nMy co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.\n\nFood - \n\nThe Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     \n\nPortion -\n\nThis should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.\n\nService - \n\nMy waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.\n\nPrice - \n\nThe cost ranges $5 - 10.\n\n\nI will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants.', positive, 6, 4

'I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \n\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a \'mixed grill.\"  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that\'s fresh.\n\nWe want to return sometime for \"turkey day.\"  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\n\nCan\'t wait to return.', positive, 1, 1

'On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\nWe arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\nInside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\nThe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\nAfter reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \nHis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\nThe Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I\'m glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn\'t finish it all and that\'s rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\nEverything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\nMy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\nIt usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\nCoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\nWhile I can\'t say it\'s the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we\'ve had.', positive, 1, 1
'Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don\'t expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn\'t throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn\'t factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya!', positive, 1, 0

'I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They\'re not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).', positive, 1, 0

I saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it. The soup was a  Lobster Bisque and it was amazing.....creamy deliciousness. I could have had a quart of it. Yum!  I ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill. (When at Gab n Eat. You have to order the 1/2 grill) I had mine with bacon. Bacon was crisp and delish. and M ordered the regular mixed grill.

'We came here once before and remember it not being very good, but figured we\'d give it another shot since it\'s pretty close to our home. It\'s still just OK. We didn\'t have to wait this time (Saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it\'s extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we\'ve been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It\'s almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it\'s CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I\'m pretty sure this wasn\'t noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. Thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, but\'s not a good way to end the meal when you\'re scrambling and digging for change. There are a lot of good diners in the area, so I doubt we\'ll be going back.', negative, 0, 0

'They have done it again! Excellent little establishment with their home town feeling. Mix match coffee mugs, smiling waitresses, open front diner kitchen feel.

Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what\'s to complain about there?  My Date got the bagel sandwich and \"Hey Rayed\" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well.

'Best I can say is that it\'s ok. Very small and compact. I went with my one and a half year old daughter and the booths are so crammed in that there is no room for high chairs (pretty sure they don\'t even have high chairs). They did have booster seats, but it was not ideal.\n\nFood was ok. Nothing special. I had sausage and cheese omlette and got a pancake for my daughter. Again, just ok.\n\nIt was hot in there and I don\'t think they have AC. There was a fan in front, but that did little for us who where sitting in the back.\n\nThis place is cash only. I didn\'t see anything on my way in stating that, but I could have missed it. It doesn\'t say Cash Only anywhere inside or on the menu either. There is an ATM, but it has a $2 charge to use. Can\'t believe a place in 2016 doesn\'t take cards.\n\nProbably won\'t ever go back since there are similar breakfast places closer to where I live that are more kid friendly, have better food and AC and accept more than just cash.', negative, 0, 0

But I can design my perfect breakfast because they serve half waffles and single French toasts! I hate having to choose between sweet and savory breakfast and, at Gab & Eat, you don\'t have to. Everything I\'ve eaten here has been very good. \nWaffles = gooood. \nSausage Patties= gooood. \nMixed grill = gooooood. \nPepper, onion, sausage, cheese, and potato omelet = so so so good. \n\nYou really can\'t go wrong here.

'Barb\'s Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.

Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There\'s nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma\'s kitchen.\n\nI know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb\'s can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you\'ve gotta try!', positive, 3, 1

'My first time going to Barb\'s Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn\'t.\n\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\n\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn\'t on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\n\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you\'d expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\n\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\n\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb\'s.', negative, 1, 0

'I\'ve stayed at a couple of Extended Stay sites that I found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good. Excellent place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh. It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. \n\nThe rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state \"full kitchen\" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. \n\nThe room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. \n\nThe best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.

We had to take used wash clothes and towels to front desk every day to receive fresh ones. The toilet ran over and the heater didn\'t work until we decided to leave.

'We traveled to Pittsburgh for a wedding and chose to stay at this extended stay. The photos were nice, and the reviews were decent.

It stank so bad of smoke in there that when I came home, I had to wash my clean clothes because they smelled of smoke as well. Not to mention my allergies were in full effect. The bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of. The door opened to about 1cm from the toilet so you have to wedge yourself between the door and sink. Breakfast was pathetic.

If you\'re not looking for Irish food, then try the grilled cheese- and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together. It\'s big and the cheese is thick and gooey.

'If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I\'ve always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \"pies\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I\'d probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out.

'Okay, so hopefully you haven\'t been enjoying happy hour @ Riley\'s Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \n\nTo recap: Murphy\'s Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan\'s Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy\'s Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley\'s Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\n\nIt\'s a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \n\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It\'s actually pretty funny if you\'re not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \n\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \n\nGet it together, Murphy\'s ... er, I mean Sullivan\'s....er, I mean Paddy\'s or is it Riley\'s? ;  ).

'The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.\n\nRather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.\n\nThe driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. \n\nSo I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.\n\nI would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it\'s residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I\'d never order from again anyway.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town.', negative, 3, 0

'Some of the worst pizza I\'ve ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn\'t even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I\'m serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \n\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \"steak\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \n\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I\'d never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!', negative, 0, 0
'Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20\'s working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.

'Chose Denny\'s for a very late (1:30pm) Sunday brunch. No wait. Quickly greeted and served. I ordered the half size of Moon Over My Hammy. It was just the right amount of food for me, and the hash browns were delicious! Only thing lacking was Frank\'s Red Hot :-) Son and husband very pleased with their meals, can\'t remember the names but see pic. Patron next to us gave us $5 off $20 check, so our total came to $16!

'I like the food at Denny\'s more than meals served at pricier restaurants. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn\'t advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn\'t have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park and Max and Erma\'s have gone downhill in the past few years, but the food at Denny\'s has gotten better.', positive, 0, 0

'I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.

The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!', positive, 0, 0
'I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn\'t exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn\'t welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn\'t feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?', negative, 1, 0
'This is a gym, that part is true.\n\nBut it\'s not well maintained.  It\'s dingy and the locker rooms are abysmal, basically unusable.  There\'s a pretty wide range of equipment, but not enough of it to really go around.  If you\'re into free weights, that area is larger, but over crowded and very dungeony (personally I go for that, just saying).\n\nThe place must have a REALLY conservative owner as well, because all the TVs play FOX News all day long.  If you ask the staff for another channel, they will get around to changing it about half the time, the other half of the time you\'ll be ignored and forced to watch a bunch of awful talking heads tell you lies the entire time you\'re trying to run or lift.  Part of the problem is that the owner is cheap and not paying for cable where he can change the channel on the TVs individually.  They are linked to one box only.\n\nThe place also lets a whole ton of personal trainers basically do whatever they want.  This means that the area set aside for abdominal exercises, stretching, the rock climbing wall (which I\'ve never once seen turned on or used) is over crowded with a punch of really out of shape people who are mostly carrying on conversations with their incredibly beefy personal trainers, because hey, the trainer is getting paid either way, if you want to waste your time chatting, they don\'t mind.', negative, 1, 0

'I spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk, as a business is liable to their customers if someone was to slip and fall due to negligence on the business\'s part. He told me good luck and that I\'m liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy. After two years at this gym I\'m fed up with the way they treat their customers. He told me he was fed up with me since I gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago (which they\'ve had towels since then). They never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and don\'t crash your car. Aside from that, this gym is well just that a gym. My biggest critic (aside from rude management and negligence) would have to be that they don\'t encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room. There aren\'t towels and spray around the weight machines, which I\'ve never had an issue with, but I\'d hate to see that happen. I always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine, cause well that\'d be pretty nasty. It is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio. The workers well they\'re mostly young and don\'t really care too much (the man who told me I was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner). They tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isn\'t busy, which can be pretty annoying. Their cardio room always has Fox News on two tvs and then the middle TV has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv. They recently haven\'t even been putting pens games and stuff on. Must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max 32 in the middle and 24 on the sides probably. If I had to pay full price for my membership I probably wouldn\'t belong here, but it\'s through my insurance. That said I don\'t swipe my card like most people in the front on my own. The machine is behind the counter. One guy always shows me how to do it myself, which was helpful the first time cause people aren\'t always around the front desk. That said when he is standing behind there chatting I would expect him to do it since it\'s his job. This gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy, but do you really need a fancy looking gym? Their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours I\'ve never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical. They actually even have two hellix trainers, which aren\'t super common yet. Sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them. I\'ve run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if I should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no they\'re useless. This gym makes a killing from a) classes b) it\'s convenient and c) their personal training is a separate company (warrior fitness). I\'ve been meaning to sign up for a trainer and I always see them busy. They all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging. Not sure if they have a separate yelp page, but I would say from what I\'ve seen they\'d bust your ass for sure!', negative, 0, 0
'As a member for now 8 years I can honestly say, I have never had a negative experience at Amerifit!  The owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction.  The owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed, interacts with the members, and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself.  \nThere is another review on here stating the lot didn\'t have any attention after which was the largest ice storm we\'ve had in years. I would like to state I was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot.  The owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot. However on that day I believe everyone\'s car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own.  If you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day, you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.\nI love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building.  Amerifit has such a welcoming, no intimidation, home-like feel which is what I believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last 8 years.', positive, 0, 0
'This is review rating may not be for everyone.\n\nAmerifit is a gym where many serious body builders work out.   This is an anti-Planet Fitness (there are no pizza days).   This place is where private personal trainers take on clients who do not have an affiliation with Planet Fitness.  You can pay $5 per day if you want to meet occasionally.\n\nWhat the casual person may see upon entering:\n\nYou will hear lots of grunting and weights being dropped.   Do not be intimidated.   The folks (men and ladies) are doing this for competitions (usually).\n\nThe place may seem run down (older weights / machines).   Do not let this deceive you.   \n\nThe place may seem small.   Again - do not let this deceive you.  They have smaller rooms / areas.\n\nThey do have classes upstairs that seem pretty intense (not my cup of tea).\n\nWhy 4 Stars:\n\n1. I followed my trainer (which means I chose my trainer at a location where we could work out).   My previous trainers were great but I did not necessarily like the gym (too crowded or not enough room to work out).\n\n2. Equipment variety.   Example - Cardio Equipment.   Usually when you go into a gym, you will have a treadmill, a stepper, a recumbent bike, bike, elliptical) - All one type.    Amerifit provides a variety of machines such as Cybex.   Cybex is your traditional elliptical but you can control the elevation as well.   They also have machines that will simulate ice skating\n\n3.  Intensity - You do see people seriously working out.   This can either motivate or intimidate you.  It motivates me.   I can also see folks doing exercises correctly.\n\n4.  The folks are nice.   All the associates I have met are very nice.\n\nI apologize to the serious body builders for writing this review, but I think this is a very good secret to share.  Find you a trainer, meet him/her at Amerifit, and workout.   \n\nThis is not a chain gym where everything is new with standard (usually leased) equipment.', positive, 2, 0
'I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J\'s last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.\n\nMy pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.\n\nWell, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. \n\nThe first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. \n\nCan I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can\'t get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\n\nI know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)', positive, 2, 2

'This is one of my husband\'s fave restaurants in town. My husband generally orders Chicken Parm, which is very good. Their sauce is quite good. They serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum.\n\n I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can\'t recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that\'s just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. \n\nThe place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the \'burgh. \n\nUnfortunately, we\'ve never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner!', positive, 0, 0

I couldn\'t finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.\n\nI finished up with a coffee.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street, but it\'s a small town atmosphere in Carnegie, PA.

'What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J\'s and boy did they send us to a great place.\n\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \n\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don\'t think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \n\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \n\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \n\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don\'t really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J\'s.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!', positive, 3, 0

The crust was great, the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient. \n\nOur friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was, this was _much_ better. \n\nWe\'ll return again to this beautifully lit gem in Carnegie PA soon!', positive, 1, 0

We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\n\nJust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.

'I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J\'s. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn\'t know the menu. As I said before, I\'ve been to PaPa J\'s a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn\'t explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn\'t just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn\'t care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn\'t have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn\'t really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! They didn\'t remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn\'t good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald\'s that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren\'t happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I\'m not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.', negative, 5, 1
'This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious.

'Great place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.\n\nPapa J\'s is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don\'t have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn\'t always open. I really don\'t understand why more people don\'t go here. \nMy favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. \n\nAlso, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. We had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food.', positive, 0, 0

She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections... \n\nNow... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said \'well they didn\'t speak up!\' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said \'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?\'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn\'t even sing!  We were mad!!\n\nThe place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.   \n\nSo good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we\'d like to go back again, but we want Jasmine!', positive, 0, 0

'I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won\'t go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn\'t coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that\'s it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I\'ll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around.', negative, 1, 0
'Delicious!  Everything I\'ve ever had here was great!  The white pizza is a MUST!  Always amazing!  I\'m also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  The bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  Their prices are also reasonable.  Overall, I highly recommend this place!', positive, 1, 2
'2nd times a charm. This place was 3.5 starts the first time I came, but stepped up large tonight.  Waitress was righteous and very fun.  Food was all excellent.  Caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  Can\'t wait for the leftovers!!  The white pizza is that star though.  The crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  I don\'t throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  Good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.

'It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal.

'We stopped at Papa J\'s last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \"yep\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \"What do you want me to do\"?\n\nMy friend said \"An apology would be a good start\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \"Get out and don\'t come back\" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J\'s is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J\'s. They understand the concept of  customer service.', negative, 6, 1

'Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.\n\nThe bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.\n\nI\'m looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I\'m saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.', positive, 0, 0
'Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn\'t want to deal with it.  Seriously, I\'d rather eat at the OG.', negative, 1, 0
'Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband\'s pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn\'t even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn\'t even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don\'t waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.', negative, 4, 1

'I struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me. First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie\'s main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. \n\nThe food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else. \n\nNow the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars. \n\nThe service - Our server was...well....I\'m not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, \"Is he on crack?\" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.\n\nOverall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. However, I think I would try somewhere else to dine.', negative, 1, 0

'Did dinner with my GF last Saturday at PaPa J\'s prior to going to the Off The Wall Theater. This was the first time we\'ve been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley\'s Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.\n\nThe place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that\'s why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.\n\nAfter viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it\'s really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.\n\nOver all I give PaPa J\'s a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area\'s seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn\'t feel as if I\'ve been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal. I only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner.', positive, 2, 0
'A unique and great find in downtown Carnegie. My fiance and I came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spots. We had the sausage stuffed pepperoncini\'s as an appetizer (these are never my favorite and were just OK, but the marinara served with them was very tasty, as was their homemade bread), I had a really great wood fired meatball/ ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it was FANTASTIC. Not overly sweet, crunchy-chocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chips. Amazing. We will definitely be back here!', positive, 0, 0

'I wrote a letter to the Papa J\'s, but did not receive a reply therefore I will share my experience online.\n\nTonight a friend and I dined at your location. We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.\nThe side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.\n \n  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to \"put it in\". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. \n \n  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.\nThe chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and sautéed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.\nThe sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.\n\n  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.\nI would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and \nI saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.\nI am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.  I hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business.', negative, 6, 0
'This is it. My favorite in the Pittsburgh area. \n\nI moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal I had back. There was a table of Italians speaking Italian behind me - how much more authentic can you get?!?\n\nI bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed. My recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza (or however it\'s spelled) and then one of the specials. If you aren\'t into a special, you\'ll be fine - order off the menu. But the specials are typically amazing. \n\nWhen my better half was living 4 hours away, he drove into town and I made him get back in he car to go here.

'One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!  Reasonable prices & delicious food.  Only one weird quirk - they don\'t bring the delicious fresh bread until you order - but it is complementary (sometimes they will if you ask nicely, but it doesn\'t come automatically). \n\nEverything is super fresh - my friends & I always order a salad or two as a starter (they are huge & don\'t offer side portions) - I strongly recommend the panzanella salad.  \n\nThen, any of the pastas. Seriously, they are all good!  \n\nIf you remember to save room for dessert - the cakes are all GIANT!  Definitely enough to share (probably with a large table).', positive, 0, 0
'We visited on 11/15 with a party of 15.  While I know a party of 15 can be overwhelming, we did call in advance for reservations. Thus, allowing proper staffing. We arrived early and headed to the bar. The bartender there greeted us quickly and took great care of us. When it was time for our reservation we were seated immediately. That is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst. We sat for 20 minutes before a server came to our table. At that point, she said I\'ll grab you water and bread.  Another 10 minutes go by and members of our party went to the bar to grab drinks as the server vanished (still no water or bread). She finally comes back to the table with bread (no waters) and takes our drink orders (about 40 mins into sitting at the table). Next thing we know, a nice gentleman by the name of Patrick is our NEW server. He really stepped up the service and should be commended. However, we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold. We also ordered the \"incredible white pizza\" which was incredibly cold. While Patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible.\nNot once did the front of house manager come check on us. \nThis is the second time I\'ve visited and the 2nd time I\'ve been disappointed.\nAlso, I wrote to the restaurant and received no response.', negative, 0, 0
'I never write reviews but my New Year\'s Eve was ruined due to how awful my experience was. \n\nThe food was subpar but it was a lost cause by the time we got it. For $50 a person it was terrible.

But as for the real issue....\n\nLast night for NYE we went for dinner with the intention of going out to celebrate after. we had reservations for 7pm made weeks in advance. We didn\'t get our food until around 930 and didn\'t get our check for another hour. We were there for an hour and a half before we even got bread. Everything we asked for was \"I\'ll get it to you in a little bit.\" I ordered a drink 3 times and never got it. I don\'t understand because it was not busy at all and they only had a select menu. You\'d think they\'d have a handle on things. How don\'t you have salads ready and made in a cooler or bread baskets prepared when reservations were made weeks ago? \n\nAnyway, we all ended up missing our reservations at other events we had planned for after dinner.

'My husband and I dinned at Papa J\'s last evening with another couple.  We came equipped with up to $ 14.00 off coupon we had planned to use, and they planned on using their Entertainment Book coupon.

But we protested, there are 2 couples here, paying on separate checks, so can\'t understand this rule.  Said they would take up to 3 Entertainment Book coupons per table, but not the one that drew us in from online Clipper Magazine.  What difference does it make which coupon you use???? If you allow one, why not the other!  Not building a \"come back\" attitude for us customers, and we don\'t intend to go back.  Some food was really good, while other meals were just ok, esp. in portion size.  All menu items are ala carte, so pretty pricey, so coupon discount would have been nice.

I haven\'t been here in years and now I remember why. \n\nWe picked the calamari pepper topped for an appetizer and it was fabulous. It better have been at $13. \nThey had numerous specials and the females picked the gnocchi entrees which were fantastic but at a price tag of $25 per, which we only discovered at bill time. Shame on us for not asking the price and no wonder the server was pushing those dishes. I had the chicken parm and it was a nice portion for $15. \nThe cappuccino cheesecake was good but small at $6.

'THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn\'t know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \"dentist\" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \"you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn\'t feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \"bone graft\". So, I signed everything. I wasn\'t even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \"dentist\" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I\'m assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100\% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn\'t sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don\'t expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.', negative, 3, 0

'Despite the low rating here on Yelp, I don\'t feel this dental office is all that bad. The office looks new or renovated, clean and organized. Emmert Dental has three locations: Settler\'s Ridge, Market Square and Bethel Park. I\'m usually a patient of the Market Square location of Emmert Dental and so far, I prefer the Settler\'s Ridge location. I came here for an emergency appointment and this was the only office that could squeeze me in. I arrived 15 minutes early and they called me back exactly at my appointment time. The assistant was so friendly and made me feel comfortable at all times. The doctor was also friendly and made a great effort to make sure I left satisfied. I was in and out in a matter of minutes and the service was great.', positive, 2, 2

This was three years ago and my teeth are fine, still no cavities. \n\nI don\'t believe in going to a dental chain and I don\'t recommend anyone else goes either.

The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there.

They\'ve got lots of cool items all over the store that you\'re convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you\'re looking for something specific, good luck. It\'s not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It\'s that when you find the right section, there\'s either nothing in stock, or they simply don\'t even carry what you need. \n\nI stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \n\nPlus the prices at Michael\'s are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I\'m already at tend Waterfront.

But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server\'s name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it. \nWhat made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that \"ok, may be it\'s been 10 minutes, but it\'s coming\". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it\'s only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that\'s not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time. \nThe food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold. \nWe were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE. I had to ask for mine, but by that point I was in no mood to take a sip even. \nI paid ($58.20) and I again got the same gentleman who tried (again!) to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes, and that \"given everything, we were within normal limits\".

'I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.\n\nGranted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn\'t paid already.  \n\nWhile sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn\'t that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.\n\nWhen I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \"steakburger\" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.\n\nAll this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.', negative, 2, 1

I haven\'t been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \n\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we\'re girls, it\'s acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she\'s not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that\'s right....\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \"bathroom break\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn\'t have time to wash her hands.

The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese.

So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold.

'As far as I\'m concerned, Filene\'s Basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessories.\r\n\r\nAs a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I\'m not wearing the same thing every time. The dresses on the second floor usually range from $30-60 and are good for over a year.

'Well, the experience did not start well. When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.\n\nSo there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn\'t too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn\'t get to or forced things that just weren\'t going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.\n\nThey played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears\' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn\'t know it (like Toxic) they\'d find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.\n\nPart of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.\n\nMy friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn\'t great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn\'t that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.\n\nIf in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun.', positive, 0, 0
'While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we\'d see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It\'s apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.\n\nSing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB\'s in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV\'s, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn\'t a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I\'d say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.\n\nThis particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE\'s party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.\n\nThere were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto\'s Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV\'s \"Growing Pains.\" I was sold from that point on.\n\nI will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I\'m not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn\'t bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.\n\nDrinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn\'t brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn\'t scary and I\'m not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. \n\nThe only down side to everything was group seating as you\'re sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. \n\nOoops!\n\nAll and all a good time and someplace I\'d certainly return to if for any reason I\'d be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car.', positive, 1, 0
'In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn\'t really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it\'s not worth it.

But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! \n\nThe guys who play are incredibly talented. There\'s 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. \n\nMy favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They\'ll all four get on stage and play two piano\'s, a guitar and drums.

'Lame. Lame as heck.\n\nThe premise seemed kind of fun, but when I got there it did not take long for Sing Sing to disappoint. The $7 cover was way too high for this place, and the drinks were not good. The music the guys played was all stuff from like 1987. Nothing modern, mostly stuff you would hear on Bob FM during the two o\'clock hour at work. The medley from Grease was a crowd pleaser I guess.\n\nPart of their schtick is that if a member of your party is having a birthday or wedding or what have you then you can pay to have that person dragged on stage and they will sing a song to them. They were doing dirty versions of well known songs, and there was really only one joke.  \"Hey there Delilah\" became \"Hey There V****a\" and that was the cleverest one. Hope you like 7th grade dirty jokes, because you\'ll be hearing a lot of them. Mostly ones that you already know from 7th grade.\n\nI would not recommend anybody go.

It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.', negative, 1, 0

'Picture Billy Joel\'s \"Piano Man\" DOUBLED mixed with beer, a rowdy crowd, and comedy - Welcome to Sing Sing!  A unique musical experience found in Homestead.\n\nIf you\'re looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They\'ll play anything you\'d like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.\n\nThe crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it\'s harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you\'re wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It\'s the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn\'t want that?\n\nDueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing!', positive, 3, 1
'First time here tonight and I must say I wasn\'t sure if I wanted to go. It seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but I decided to go with friends and man did I have a blast. The $7 door charge was great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am ( we left shortly after 1). The food was not super but good prices reasonable. The beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts. I asked for something similar to yeungling but what I got was nothing like it. The musicians were great they made this place awesome. We will b back and this may b our new Pittsburgh hangout', positive, 0, 0
'Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I\'ll be returning! It was a blast!!!\n\nIt was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you\'re going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! \n\nI had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I\'ve ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! \n\nI did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can\'t wait to go back!', positive, 0, 0
'My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn\'t really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \n\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they\'re covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It\'s obvious they\'ve been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it\'s rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \"Rubber Ducky\" and \"Gangsta\'s Paradise\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \"anything else,\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \"yinz\" instead of \"you.\"\n\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there\'s not even an intermission. I\'ve read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend\'s birthday. \"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\" he said when she requested him.\n\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can\'t laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\n\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\n\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbräuhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list.', positive, 1, 1
'Always a good time, although it\'s definitely not a place I would visit often. It\'s great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \n\nShut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. \n\nMy big criticism is the set up. If you don\'t have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it\'s difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don\'t mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else\'s empty glasses.', positive, 5, 3
'I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \"you bitch, you slut, you whore\" and  \"twinkle twinkle little slut, why don\'t you take it up the butt\" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not.', negative, 0, 0

'I brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper.  The damage was minimal, but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting.  The staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck.  They completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job.  A few weeks later, I noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question.  I would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done.', positive, 2, 0
'I was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop, from the very first time I took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when I got my car repaired (they still remembered me!). One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn\'t believe how annoying it is when businesses don\'t do this during normal business hours. They\'re so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn\'t turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it\'s a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.\n\nFran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio\'s (with an \"i\" not an \"l\") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.\n\nOverall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn\'t match) and get a brand new bumper. They blended the paint for me, washed, waxed, and vacuumed my car, AND their work has a lifetime guarantee. What can I say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other Yelpers can find this helpful, as this is how I found out about them.', positive, 3, 1
'From my first phone call to Joe Diliorio\'s, I was impressed. Every staff member I spoke too was kind and eager to help. I was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision. I was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage. Joe Dilorio\'s took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in. I then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch. They masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts. My car looks even better than before the wreck!\n\nIf you don\'t want any hassle, want to be treated with respect, and want your car looking fantastic, give these guys a call!\n\n-Adam', positive, 1, 0

Everyone I worked with was courteous and pleasant, and the work was done more quickly than expected. Moreover, they found ways to help save on the expense.

'Amazing repair service. I hit a really fat raccoon in the Appalachians (it was dark and rainy and I didn\'t see the poor thing until it was too late) while going fairly fast down a hill.

Anyway, once I got back to Pittsburgh, I called my insurance agent.\n\nMy insurance referred me to DiIorios and I\'m really glad they did! The staff was very friendly and helpful doing the estimate. They even set up a rental for me when I was having the car repaired. \n\nThey kept me updated on the status of the car and were just really pleasant to work with the whole time.\n\nHopefully I don\'t have to get any body work done on my car again anytime soon, but if I do, I know I\'m going to take back to DiIorios.', positive, 0, 0

We would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed. After the installation, Lowe\'s would refund us the$ 35.00. Our paperwork said we would receive a call from an installer within 2 business days. I also had a few other questions that our salesman said the dept Manager would call me about the next day. Never received a call from anyone at Lowe\'s! By July 2 we still had not heard from the installer or the dept Manager. I called the dept manager and asked him my few questions that I had. He answered one question and said he would have another millwork person call me. Millwork never called me! By July 3, I called our salesman (David Crane). He was surprised that I had not heard from the installer. He told me he would send a message to the installation dept about calling us.Today it\'s July 8th and we STILL have not heard a peep from anyone at Lowes.

He didn\'t have exactly the fitting for a hot tub, but gave me what he thought would work. It did! Under $3 bucks later and all was a go! Winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot. My fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps. Back to plumbing section. Same gentleman. Gave me the advice again and bam, fixed! \nTHIS is what I want in customer service.

'Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders.

We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive.

'Duke...the owner...is the man.  He\'s a true Pittsburgher and he loves everyone from Pittsburgh.  He looks like he\'ll beat you up but he\'s a softy with a big heart.

I\'m sort of into that, so it doesn\'t bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos.

This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can\'t tell you a thing about it. \n\nThe biggest downfall of Duke\'s, though, is the food. I\'ve had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special.

Enjoy the fact that there are other options in the area like Dukes but our last couple visits have been very disappointing. \n\nHate to do it but I need to leave a review in hopes the manager can get things right. One of the main issues is that the kitchen is overcooking the hell out of the food I\'ve ordered the past 2 visits. \n\nI can deal with a long wait which is understandable when there is a game on but having to wait for something that comes out missing something and overcooked can be frustrating especially given the cost. \n\nLast visit was a burger. I gave up and refused the offer for another. Bartenders were super cool about it and even offered me free drink tokens which I decided to redeem today. \n\nI felt bad just ordering free beer so I ordered a sandwich. It was the roast beef and turkey club which was described specifically on the menu as medium rare which sounded pretty good to me. The roast beef was beyond that. I would say extra well done. Obviously one of the chefs is struggling but I\'m not totally sure that the beef was cooked in house. I\'m not a chef but know when to pull a roast beef out of the cooker to achieve the proper temp. Anyway I decided not to say anything since the sandwich was still pretty edible and because of my girlfriend being embarrassed of me complaining. \n\nDecent beer selection. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Bar staff not so much this visit. We were ignored until I grabbed a table in the back. Neither of us weren\'t very happy about this. Possibly a no standing policy since there was only one empty chair at the bar? At least say something/acknowledge the customer that has been standing clearly in your view for 10 min obviously waiting for a drink.', negative, 0, 0
'Duke\'s is one of Pittsburgh\'s best kept secrets in my opinion and one of my favorite spots to drink. The interior is really nice, the outdoor section is also really spacious and great for warm weather days. Beer selection is great and the bartenders/waitstaff are ALWAYS on their game. When I come with large groups I find that the waitresses are always very attentive and quick on their feet. If I had one minor complaint it would be with the food. Some people might like it but when it comes to appetizers I just find that they go wayyyy overboard with the greasiness/breading. I would highly recommend Duke\'s to anyone who is looking to mix it up.', positive, 0, 0
'GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!  \n\nA FAMILY GATHERING!  \n\nA WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  \n\nOR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!\n\nA combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!\n\nThe Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  \n\nThe Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B\'s in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\n\nThe one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.\n\nWonder if they\'ll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. \n\nWHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  \n\nPOWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  \n\nA GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You\'ll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. \n\nTime will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  \n\nDAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!\n\nFUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!', positive, 2, 2
'D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.\n\nYou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\n\nWaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\n\nThe games are all violent shooters or racing games don\'t appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\n\nNot a pleasant experience, but at least it\'s different from going to an ordinary restaurant.', negative, 1, 3
'Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.\n\nMy mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.  \n\nI like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we\'ll just stop by for drinks instead.', negative, 0, 0
'I love the games here but can\'t go very often since they don\'t rotate new games in very often.

'Dave and Buster\'s is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it\'s overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \n\nNext, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn\'t?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. \n\nThe games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\n\nOverall Dave and buster\'s is unique to the Waterfront, but it\'s time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.', negative, 2, 0
'The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! \n\nOur waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   \n\nThe manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn\'t eat was free.', negative, 1, 0
'The usual fun center.\n\nYou can play games using a play card which you purchase there.  Game prices can be confusing- - -  2.3, 5.7, 9.9 credits, etc.\n\nThe arcade can be fun if you bring some friends.  \n\nAlmost every game is a ticket game and there are few innovative or exciting game choices.\n\nI didn\'t eat there, so I can\'t rate the restaurant part of Dave and Busters.', positive, 1, 1
'We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn\'t as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don\'t win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B\'s I\'ve been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn\'t try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang\'s to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion.', positive, 1, 1
'Not much of a review for this one, but just a few tidbits of info...\n\nPool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour\n(I\'m pretty sure its $10 through the week)\n\nMixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.\nThe food is crap.\n\nThe games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they\'re the big tournament style/size, not the shitty bar-room, tiny pool tables).\n\nThat is all.  :)\n\n(the pricing is based on my recent trip.\nWe shot pool for a few hours, I had a bar tab (that wasn\'t out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60', negative, 1, 1

'Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey.', positive, 0, 0
'When did Dave and Buster\'s become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn\'t even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\nI get that Dave and Buster\'s is an arcade and that you\'re going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I\'m sure we got into some shenanigans, I don\'t remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn\'t Chuck E. Cheese, yet that\'s how parents seem to be treating the place.\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you\'re table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster\'s is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I\'ve ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn\'t because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn\'t worth it. \nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \nAll in all, I didn\'t like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can\'t recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.', negative, 0, 0

'My friend and I both had Friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on Thursday night. We settled on Dave and Busters. I went on Facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)\n\nThe games weren\'t *quite* as fun as I remembered, but it was still a good time. The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. \n\nI think a lot of companies (I\'m looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.\n\nDrinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my Tropical Mojito was awesome! My friend and I are definitely planning on going back on a Wednesday for half-price games AND half-price drinks.', positive, 0, 0

'Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven\'t been to this Dave and Buster\'s since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn\'t ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here\'s where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she\'d come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn\'t came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he\'s really busy right now. I doubt he\'ll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that\'s one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn\'t even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!', negative, 1, 1

GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out.

'My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don\'t think we\'ll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn\'t work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I\'m I have no doubt it\'s due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It\'s a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!', negative, 1, 0

'Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.\n\nThe main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We\'d never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.\n\nYour visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You\'ll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you\'ll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\n\nThe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \n\nNote the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That\'s typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we\'re courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. \n\nAlso note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You\'re supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I\'ve seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One\'s). \n\nThe thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it\'s all families and Friday and Saturday night it\'s all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that\'s why the reviews are all over the place.\n\nThis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.\n\nUsing survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you\'ll have a great experience for $25-40/person.\n\nI really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional.

'After having a few \'less than memorable\' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new \'watering holes\' every thursday and it\'s run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  \n\nAnyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back \'pool room\' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  \n\nI had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.

'Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn\'t really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn\'t ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt\'s a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.', negative, 0, 0
'I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \"games\", you can\'t even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.', negative, 0, 0

We ordered and got our drinks and well let\'s just say we didn\'t see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).

The outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste. The fish itself was bland. After a few bites I called over the waiter who was very nice and funny and complained by showing him how hard the fish was by tapping the fish against the plate making a loud thud noise. He grabbed my plate and took it to his manager. But before doing so asked if I wanted something else I said no I had lost my appetite.

'I\'ll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \"donate\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you\'re lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. \nIn regards to the games, there\'s a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I\'ve gone I\'ve gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!).

The manger blamed us saying \" you came with a large party on a sat night, if you only order apps and not separate  meals, you MIGHT get food in 45 min\" really ? It\'s the customers fault your staff can\'t handle a sat night rush. The table of 5 next to us waited 3 hours for food, when they got it it was the WRONG food... I will never spend money here again!!!\nTo top it off the bathroom had no toilet paper and there was pee everywhere!', negative, 0, 0
'This is a really fun way to spend an afternoon. After several visits here, I\'ve found a couple games that are easy to win and score you lots of tickets, and others that are just a blast to play. We did really awesome last time we were here, and their prize room is full of some pretty neat stuff. \n\nTheir food is not too bad. I\'ve only ever eaten here once, and it wasn\'t that memorable, but I didn\'t hate it. I did like that they have a bar, and they had my favorite beer on tap, that was nice. \n\nLike pretty much any arcade I\'ve ever been to, there are things that are a rip off, and occasionally something won\'t work properly. That really irritates some people but I figure no arcade is perfect. At least none that I\'ve ever been to. The most irritating thing for me is that some of the games have a call button on them that signals an employee to come assist you, and I kept hitting the button with my leg or something, so every once in awhile someone would randomly appear at my side and ask if I needed help, and I would be really confused. haha. \n\nWe went here with my husband\'s family on Thanksgiving, and we had a total blast. The whole place was pretty empty, and I felt really bad for the employees that had to work that day, but it was nice for us!', positive, 0, 1

'4 Stars for the fun factory, games, and all around experience, but 2 stars for the disgusting food and horrible service!\n\nI was SO excited to come here for my boyfriends birthday. Its always fun to play games, win tickets, and have fun with friends/family. We decided to eat here before we played. I keep seeing commercials for their new menu, so hey it couldn\'t be bad right? Wrong! Only thing that was really good was the Corona-rita - but that\'s hard to mess up. \n\nFirst off, service was horrible. I didn\'t feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow, but apparently I was wrong. It took about 15 minutes, minimum, to get our first drinks. At least an hour for our food. I have boneless buffalo wings, which are hard to screw up, so mine weren\'t bad but they weren\'t the best. My boyfriend had their Philly Cheesesteak and he couldn\'t finish it. Was SO salty and just not good. For the price of everything, it was not worth it all. Better off going somewhere else in the Waterfront for food and then coming here to play. You\'ll save $$, time, and frustration! \n\nI guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a make-shift area to cash in your tickets. Everything was pretty picked over, which kinda sucked. Overall it was still fun, and I am sure I will be back to play some more games!', negative, 3, 1
'The service at the Pittsburgh location was so incredible awful that I actually took the time out of my day to write online how disappointed I was, which I have never done before. It was a Saturday night and as someone who works in a restaurant im very sympathetic when it comes to service. We sat at the high tables in the bar area and we did not get greeted or even acknowledged for 30 minutes. I personally had to get a manager and explain to him the situation and he treated me like I was stupid (maybe because im 17?) Also not to mention the little girl next to me is balling her eyes out because she told her server of an egg allergy she has and they still managed to mess it up and give her food marinated in egg. Last I overhead they are heading to the hospital. I\'m not writing this message to be spiteful, I\'m writing it in hopes that the future of your restaurant will improve. There\'s a big difference between service and hospitality and right now this place is lacking both. My best wishing for improvement', negative, 0, 0
'Can we get a maintenance man?  And a janitor?  And a manager?   No?  Ok...\n\nI had a good time at Dave and Buster\'s, but that was based mainly on the company I kept and not the venue.   We went right when they opened for the day, with the intention of playing some pool.  We located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off, so we went to the hostess stand to ask.  She radioed for help, got none, and finally went in search of an answer our question.  When she came back, she said she couldn\'t find anyone, but a manager would be out to talk to us.   We wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.   \n\nAll but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didn\'t work.  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).   \n\nAnd we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn\'t work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn\'t the cleanest place I\'ve ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn\'t look as though they\'d been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).\n\nOverall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.  The broken games were sort of comical after a while, but definitely not in a good way.  If you are really looking to do this type of activity, I\'d try a different location for sure.', negative, 2, 0
'Over priced, over hyped but a hell of a time regardless.  I think if you have a big screen tv at home and a wii you could order pizza get beer and have friends over and have the same experience without the price and glitz.  I\'ve yet to eat something here that impressed me.  The arcade is a bit dated but I like playing the big trivia game more than anything (again, you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit).  The new TV set up is pretty cool, but Dave and Busters is just what it is, an adult Chuckie Cheese not worth more than a visit a year, if that.', negative, 1, 0
'I\'ve probably only been to 3 Dave & Buster\'s in my life, but this is probably my favorite one.

The prizes are also better here, and the ticket exchange rate for the prizes seemed a lot more fair too.

'I have been to Dave and Busters multiple times and i feel its a 2 star place.\n\nI can say the food quality is sub par.  In my opinion the food prices are expensive for what it is and quality.  They do offer a nice bar,but then again the prices in my opinion are a little higher.  Service isn\'t too bad, but could be better.\n\nD&B is a great place for adults for sure, but the prices for tokes or \"game play\" is a little ridiculous.  Some games charge 6.9 credits to place.  Thats almost saying $1.50 a game and some of those games are addicting where I know most of us keep playing.  \n\nI also thing D&B isn\'t the cleanest place either.  The bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion.  Doesn\'t seem like they keep up with it.  To me, thats a big factor in rating restaurants.   \n\nAll in all, D&B is an ok place to visit, but not a place i would frequently waste my money.', negative, 1, 0

The room was spacious, well-appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications. The buffet was delicious. The manager, servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive. What a wonderful facility.\n\nKids and adults loved the arcade games. The pool tables were a hit too. We appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove.\n\nIn the months leading up to our event, special events representative Laura checked in regularly. She, Sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special. Thank you, D&B, for a great experience.', positive, 0, 0

'I gave D&B 4 stars because our waiter was very geniune and nice! The place has definitely changed over the years, becoming a very pricey venue. The food was mediocre. The fries were cold and the sliders were subpar, almost like White Castles from the freezer section in most grocery stores. My buffalo wings were rather tough. As for the games, they were mostly the same, but included a lot of the newer \'app\' style games like flappy bird. Skeeball and Free throw were still fun, along with the coin drop machines. But, wow, we went through $50 of games really fast. The gift section is full of fun tchotchkes and prizes if you pay enough to rack up the points! Nevertheless, it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family, friends or coworkers.', positive, 1, 0
'The food here is awful.  I came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the Waterfront.  We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us, which can be challenging.  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen, but the waitress really tried her best.\n\nI only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese.  Everyone else at the table hated their food.  They all had sandwiches or other dishes.  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through.  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our table\'s food.\n\nI was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes, but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games.  All I have to say is no thanks.', negative, 0, 0

'I\'ve loved coming here since it first opened as part of the Waterfront shopping development, and I\'m always up for a game of skee-ball!  The Pittsburgh D&B location is recently remodeled, so if you haven\'t been there in a while, do yourself a favor and check it out.  They\'ve expanded the dining areas and added new, modern furniture, there are more TVs than you can shake a stick at, a menu with something for everyone, and of course... games!  They also recently opened a new show in their theater room -- Pittsburgh magician Lee Terbosic will be performing 2 shows every Friday and Saturday night.  You can even order drinks and food off the menu while you take in the show!\n\nI went to the opening show this past Friday night, and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a \"sno-cone\" (hint: this drink isn\'t one for the kiddos!) to wash it down with.  Both were great -- the sno-cone flavors were just like an ICEE I would get on a childhood shopping trip with mom and dad, but with that added kick of booze.  Hey, I\'m not one to complain.  Speaking of added kicks, the quesadilla has jalapenos in it, which I loved!! I love spicy foods and most places just serve a little cup of jalapenos on the side.  These were actually cooked into the fillings and I loved every bite.\n\nThe show itself was highly entertaining and the crowd seemed to agree -- Lee kept everyone on their toes for the entire 60 minutes.

He was very professional (he even put booties on his feet before coming into the house), explained exactly what he was doing and described what the problem was and how to prevent it from happening in the future.  And guess what!  He CLEANS TOO!  Now, back to my laundry....what a way to spend a Friday night.', positive, 0, 0
'I can\'t say enough good things about these guys.  I swear, when it rains it pours...literally. I went down to the basement and discovered water all over the floor and a spray coming out of a water line and shooting to the ceiling. I\'ve had way too many \"oh shit\" moments like these this summer. This time, the saddle valve connection for my ice maker burst. Thank you again to Rdn Plumbing for rescuing me and installing the proper type of valve. As always, you guys were prompt and professional. :)', positive, 0, 0
'Getting a new refrigerator installed can be daunting. The delivery man could not hook it up unless the water line was on same floor. RDN  was here  while the delivery man was still here. So far, so good, right?  Even though RDN had to go back to the shop to get the correct part he came right back. Job well done. The next morning the water dispenser was only giving us a small trickle so I called for help again.  RDN was here in fifteen minutes. The installer had not blown air out of the filter first. RDN  did it.\nKudos for great, caring service.', positive, 0, 0

'We used rdn plumbing who was recommended by aha (american home shield) to help fix a clogged drain.  A guy named Justin came and helped us.  After he left the drain was unclogged but the pipe below the sink was leaking.  We left the country for vacation and have been swamped in construction afterwards.  We called aha for a recall to have rdn come back and fix the leaking pipe. I woke up at 830 am to justin screaming (and i mean screaming so loud that i was alarmed in bed with earplugs in).  He was questioning my husband about why we waited 3-4 weeks to call it in.  After my husbad explained that we were out of the country he implied thAtmy husband messed with the pipes himself.  My husband stayed calm and told him that he just needs to fix the problem from not putting pipes back together correctly.  THEN my husband askd if he could call aha and see if the leaking faucet would be covered.  He went out to his truck and called and then came barging back in with a wrench and started fixing the faucet by literally turning the wrench twice.  He told my husband while turning the wrench that it wasnt covered.  My husband tried to get im to stop because he only wanted to know if it was covered.  Justin freaked out again and wrote up a whole new work order.  He gave us the bill and stormed off.  The even wrote on the statement \"i am not going to be told how to do my job\".  I have never seen a temper tantrum from a so called professional in my life.  I als would like to add that i have NEVER left a 1/5 stars for any service professional and we are no strangers to house remodeing.', negative, 0, 0
'Hot water tank burst in the middle of a shower, had to go to work shortly after. Got to work frustrated knowing this is really going to cost me. Remembered I had a home warranty and I called them up to see what kind of situation I\'m really in, they said no issue and contracted RDN to me. Nick? I believe it was arrived promptly this morning from RDN, was extremely professional and was more than generous with information regarding the draining of the tank on a bi-yearly basis (something of which I did not know to do). He was polite and cleaned up after himself. They alleviated my issue and made me very happy. They\'re a little out of my range for basic needs as I live roughly 40 minutes from Homestead but I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone. Awesome folks.', positive, 0, 0

Ed from RND arrived promptly, introduced himself, asked us a few questions and got right to work. He had to leave to purchase the new tank and came back in a timely manner. He was very careful not to dirty our carpeting when taking out the old tank. Ed was very professional, friendly and he helped to put my mind at ease during a stressful morning. He explained how to maintain the new tank to make it last longer. I highly recommend RND Plumbing and Their technician Ed! He certainly exceeded our expectations!!', positive, 0, 0

They never once apologized and every phone call they were trying to talk to another person about a whole different matter. And oh since we used a card it\'s going to be 3-4 days to see the refund.

'SUMMARY:\nIf I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.\n\nGOOD:\n- Decent beer...\n- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.\n- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\n- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\n- Amusing name.\n\nBAD:\n- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one\'s awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\n- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I\'ve had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\n- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\n\nCome if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.', negative, 0, 0
'I am a big fan of Rock Bottom.\nThere are several dishes that are MONEY.\nAppetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip\nEntree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.\nDesert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)\nBar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  \nHalf the menu is really good, the other half is great.  \nThe beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.\nHead over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.\nI used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.\nDon\'t go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom.', positive, 0, 0

'Nobody has reviewed this in a while, but I am surprised at the lack of lovin\'!

Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I\'m looking forward to trying.\n\nWe are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!\n\nOur food and service was great.

'This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn\'t sit at the bar and I don\'t drink alcohol so I can\'t comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night.

'Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I\'ve ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom.', negative, 3, 1

'First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn\'t a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender\'s attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don\'t usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn\'t do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won\'t be going too often, but I will be back.', positive, 0, 0
'Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly.', positive, 0, 0

'Rock Bottom is a nice hangout place. Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you. \n\n\nDepending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It\'s alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you\'re stocking the local comics! \n\n\nThe bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. \n\nThe menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. \n\nOn Monday the burgers are half off...I don\'t think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials. \n\nhttp://www.rockbottom.com/MC \n\nNeedless to say I have a fun beer glass collection thanks to Rock Bottom...LOL! \n\nNow everyone favorite part about Rock Bottom\'s Beers! \nThe in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of Ale, IPA\'s, Rotating Darks and Kolsch. \n\nStop by on Thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where teams battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skills!', positive, 3, 3
'We\'ve all had this happen to us - you go past a place one hundred times and never go on. Then, once you finally do, you realize how many opportunities you wasted!\n\nRock Bottom is definitely a solid bar. As a microbrewery, their beer list is full of house brews. There are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too. \n\nWhat really makes Rock Bottom standout, though, is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them. They also make a mean soft pretzel. \n\nThe Waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in Pittsburgh, but no trip to the Waterfront, is complete without a bite and a drink at Rock Bottom.', positive, 0, 0
'I would have to say I\'m pretty partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic \"Team Trivia\". My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. \n\nEvery week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! \n\nAs an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! \n\nAnother favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it\'s big enough for two people. \n\nThe service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. \n\nA truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! \n\nCome to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!', positive, 1, 1
'Rock Bottom on Thursday nights is the place to be. Team Trivia starts at 8pm and it is free to play. The DJ (Todd) is great. \n\nThe food is good, but the Ball Park Pretzels with Spicy Spinach Cheese dip is the best. The wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things, a few servers are excellent. I am not a beer drinking so I haven\'t tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks I\'ve had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect. \n\nOn nights that are not trivia nights, Rock Bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party. Larger parties will usually be split into two tables. \n\nOverall, an enjoyable place at which I am a regular.', positive, 0, 0
'So I have not been to one of these in awhile since I normally have an aversion to chain restaurants, but since I was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place I went along. \n\nFirst surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. \n\nService was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I\'ll be back next time I\'m in Pittsburgh for work.', positive, 0, 0
'The beer is good. Their light beer, Lumpy Dog, is very good-- doesn\'t taste like a light beer. When I was pregnant I became quite a fan of their root beer floats, too.\n\nAs others have noted, the pretzels are really good. I\'m not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. Long, long ago, when I used to go to the Rock Bottom in Boston, there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that I will gladly add another star!', positive, 0, 0
'I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let\'s be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I\'d go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that\'s a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can\'t go wrong, there\'s bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it\'s pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it\'s good, sometimes it\'s terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it\'s perfect, then maybe it\'s cold, or it\'s burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n\nThat\'s pretty much it. This place fixes it\'s food consistency, and it\'s a five star place. Till then, it\'s hit or miss!', negative, 2, 2
'I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \"brewery\" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It\'s a chain.  Whomp whomp!', negative, 7, 3
'For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.', negative, 0, 0
'I\'ve always been pleasantly surprised with the food I\'ve gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \"surprised\' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I\'ve really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don\'t get anything above and beyond this place\'s call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I\'ll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn\'t count.....).\n\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I\'ve recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I\'ve also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It\'s an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I\'m a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n\nI\'ve always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.', positive, 0, 0
'I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \"nice\" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn\'t good and the food is average, at best.\n\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they\'d have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn\'t work either. If we hadn\'t REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would\'ve just left. It definitely wasn\'t busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can\'t overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\n\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that\'s kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.', negative, 3, 2

'I haven\'t been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it\'s been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \n\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn\'t, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \n\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That\'s the empty price.  To me, that\'s a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won\'t deter me from returning.', positive, 0, 0

The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla.

It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. \n\nThe prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it\'s totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don\'t expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. \n\nI felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive.

'Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \"OK\".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \n\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren\'t anything to write home about.\n\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili\'s of Brew Pubs.

Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I\'d be fine giving this place a 3.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol\' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you\'d think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I\'d be ready to go on to the next review right there.\n\nHere\'s where I ran into problems. I\'d checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren\'t, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it\'s a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn\'t recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you\'ll do it??? \n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant\'s ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn\'t the waiter\'s fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I\'ve started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food\'s nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.', negative, 0, 0

'I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so I was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone\'s glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn\'t get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn\'t box it up.  Not sure why- they can\'t re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!\n\nAlso, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!', positive, 0, 0

'I\'m giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.   The food is pretty good, but nothing to rave about.  The menu has a good variety, and everything I\'ve tried has been good.  Portions are large.  \n\nOne side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several TV\'s & 2 pool tables.  It\'s very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  The other side is more for families or people who aren\'t concerned about watching sports.  In general, it has a relaxed atmosphere.  I\'ve always had quick & friendly service.  \n\nI love the whole Waterfront area....so much to do!', positive, 0, 0
'I\'m not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so I agreed to tag along.  I\'m glad I did!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by.', positive, 0, 0
'Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I\'ve ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.', negative, 0, 0
'I\'m a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it\'s a good option after movies. Their nachos is pretty good. I also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they\'re good as well. \nI think the only thing I did\'t like is the steak taco appetizer. It was too sour and kinda tasteless.', positive, 1, 0
'The Cajun Pasta I ordered was just spicy enough to keep me sipping my Rock Bottom IPA. It may be a chain but I always get that microbrew restaurant feel when I\'m here. They could upgrade the quality of the servers but I\'ve never had a really bad experience with the service.', positive, 0, 0

'So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn\'t so hungry I wouldn\'t have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza\'s and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn\'t have to stink...', negative, 1, 0

'Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It\'s a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.', positive, 0, 0
'I have to say that I\'ve only been here when it was very busy. I found the service fairly quick and any of the food I\'ve had has been delicious. I went there tonight and there was an issue with my food. Without going into detail, I will say they handled it wonderfully. Our waitress Mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem. I had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. I had one beer that\'s similar to a blue moon and that was good too. I would go back again!', positive, 0, 0
'My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.

'Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money.\n\nOn to the important part... Food was terrible.

'I love this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. The thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. But the servers are fantastic. Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn\'t terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert menu is a little small, but I could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. They also have outside seating available when the weather is nice I highly recommend this establishment!', positive, 0, 0

'Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It\'s one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I\'m a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I\'m going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\n\nNOTE: There aren\'t too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I\'d recommend it, but other than that, there\'s also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.', positive, 0, 0
'I\'ve never been crazy about the food here, but my friend likes it, so I do eat here once in a while. We stopped in last night and I had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. The food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. The ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it. \n\nMy friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon, which is what she orders just about every time she\'s there. It looked delicious and the portion was huge. I\'ll be trying this dish next time we\'re there. \n\nWe\'ve also had the Ball Park Pretzels in the past, and they\'re really good. \n\nI\'m giving 4 stars because the service was great, there\'s outdoor seating, and the Berry Bash Sangria was delicious (if expensive). We\'ll be back.', positive, 0, 0
'Every time I\'ve been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n\'cheese as a side. They Mac n\' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I\'ve had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. \n\nOne thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren\'t one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you\'re done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you\'re starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there\'s never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn\'t start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.\n\nMy only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that\'s not a huge problem for me. I also don\'t think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that\'s more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. \n\nOverall I definitely recommend eating here if you\'re in the Waterfront!', positive, 1, 1
'The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The Kölsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I\'ve been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it\'s a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.', negative, 0, 0
'The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I\'ve tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \"foodie\" palate, don\'t even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it.', negative, 0, 0
'I am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowly break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time. The one chain that I can\'t break from is rock bottom. \n\nTheir beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \n\nAs far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I\'ve had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \n\nAlmost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It\'s my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn\'t fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There\'s a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \n\nAnother item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I\'ve yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. \n\nThey also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \n\nTheir side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! \n\nI usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else. \n\nService is always great, the bartenders are friendly... I love this place. Ask about their rock bottom rewards !', positive, 3, 2

'I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. \n\nI prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. \n\nNachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don\'t think I\'ve had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer. \n\nThis is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can\'t order them at a beer place. I\'ve seen them and they do look good, but I\'m stuck to the beer selection. \n\nThey have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. \n\nService is always great whether there are two or 10 of us.', positive, 0, 1
'BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. \n\nI came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeño cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work.', positive, 0, 0
'We have been going to Rock Bottom for sevesrl years and Love it! It is our go to place, when we want a nice meal, in a nice atmosphere,  with good service! We have had 1 maybe 2 not so great visits but for the most part, service is EXCELLENT and the food is consistent!  After leaving another restaurant (just trying to do something new for a celebration) because of poor service, we were greeted and seated in a few seconds!  Our server was at our table within seconds even though she had a large (10 to 12 guests) Group at the table near us. We had our drinks in minutes and were checked on twice within 5 minutes.

Our server, Amanda, was very attentive, and was able to make several good beer recommendations to my husband.

'On a Friday I went to Rock Bottom with some friends for their happy hour which takes place from 4-6. Our server was a spunky brunette who was very attentive and even let us sample as many beers as we liked until deciding. I ultimately decided on the Pom-berry Cosmo which was excellent. I also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing. During happy hour it\'s only $5 and you get two big pretzels served with this delicious cheese dip. My friends got the nachos, the quesadilla, and the artichoke cheese dip. Everything was very tasty.', positive, 0, 0
'For this occasion I was with my girls, we were looking for a place to have a good lunch.  We looked around and chose Rock Bottom, we have eaten then before and enjoyed ourselves.  The server was a very nice person and was very attentive.  She when over the specials and took our drink order.   Going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the BBQ Brisket Stuffed Burger.  That just sounded so good.  Unfortunately the reality didn\'t match the idea of the burger.  The favor of the BBQ never came through and the smoked Gouda flavor was none existent. It was like having a standard old boring burger.  I was very disappointed.  For $14, I would have expected a lot more flavor.  I would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor.', negative, 0, 0

'First, I have to say that I\'ve been here twice in the past few months, and each time was with a very large group (one group of 20, one group of over 30) on a weekend evening and I\'m thoroughly impressed with the friendly, efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups. Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant\'s management and service staff, it\'s top notch.\n\nThat being said, the food and beer aint all that bad either!

'Rock Bottom: A Cautionary Yelper\'s Tale.\n\nYou might say, \"I\'ve never heard of Rock Bottom, there\'s no way that they are a chain restaurant.\" Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you\'ll end up on the rock bottom.\n\nAfter a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn\'t right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.\n\nWe waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20\% of our meal due to the terrible service. \n\nSo if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain.', negative, 2, 0
'Great bar. Great atmosphere. Great food. Cool place to be.\n\nDefinitely one of those places you could keep going back just because it\'s so chill and it\'s a great place for friends to just enjoy some drinks and eat some good food. Nothing too too spectacular by any means but satisfies the taste buds. Their apps are the best part and the highlight of the restaurant, in my opinion. The nachos can be split among 4-5 people easy.

'While this is certainly not my first meal at Rock Bottom, this is my first meal in a year or two . The wait was minuscule, and the greeter was pleasant. As always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores, the mother in law and I decided to tie the feed bag on at RB. Our server Matt was easy to work with and informative. \n\nI started off with the tortilla soup. Spicy and thick it went down easy enough. However let me say that the price at $3.50 was rather steep for the serving size. Did somebody say OUCH!! Thing one and thing two each had the \'small fry steaks\'  with fruit (cantaloupe, melons, and grapes) and steamed broccoli and at $6.75 each, I think I was \'buffaloed\' IF  you get my drift. The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of .... Hmmm. \n\nThey say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly, and thing two noticed that his was rather dry. Not the best dinner they have eaten. They say you get what you pay for OR NOT!!  \n\nMy meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $14.75 I had no complaints. It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. How can anything be wrong with that much BACON!!! \n\nThe final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $13.95 my mother in law was sated. Over all this meal was a wash.

You may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes. \n\nAs you know I vote with my feet and dollars, and neither will be there again ANY time soon!!', negative, 1, 0
'This is another one of my favorite places that had deteriorated dramatically. Corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck. The menu has gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entrees and a bunch of small plates that are ok but not great. The service has also suffered tremendously. We are abandoning this restaurant.\n\nI don\'t expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer.  In the past, on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  Last night, it was only slightly busy.  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.  The staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs.  Alas, I don\'t think that Rock Bottom will still be in business in six months.  Hopefully, if that happens, Black Rock Bar & Steak House will find its way into Pittsburgh.', negative, 1, 0
'I love Rock Bottom. I don\'t frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac \'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! \n\nI was craving the Mac \'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn\'t out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac \'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.\n\nEverything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you\'d find at any restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I\'m an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.\n\nIn the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I\'d definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.', positive, 0, 0
'Stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar. The bar tender was quick to get me a beer (the 3 Pepper Ale which was really good) but after that I was totally ignored. Tried to get the attention of the two bartenders for about a half hour while nursing my beer. They seemed to be more interested in changing dollars for quarters and washing glasses. I got feed up, finished my beer, paid my tab and went to Uno\'s. Glad I did...

'Meh is the only thing I leave here feeling.  I ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me.  For a side,  I requested the seasonal veggies (trying to be healthier) and was told it\'s a squash mixture - great I love summer squash!  \n\nI received a poorly seasoned burger. The bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement.  It was topped with an olive and a mini pickle... odd.  My \"squash\" side was lacking squash. Instead all squash was replaced by peppers... which I cannot eat.\n\nOur server was nice.  The beer was simple.  With new breweries and restaurants popping up in and around Homestead, perhaps RB should reconsider their flavors.', negative, 1, 0
'Great american style bar food with quite a lot to pick from the both the food and drink menus. They are also great at accommodating large groups and these are one of the few places that allow you to call ahead to reserve a spot. Been here plenty of times with my group and we enjoyed it every time.', positive, 0, 0

'I am a FAN of rock bottom.  This is my 2nd time here and i can say i am a FAN.  We went on a Saturday night after a day at sandcastle.  The wait was 45-60 mins for a table of 5 which was to be expected on a saturday evening. \n\nOur server wasn\'t the best in my opinion.  She was very friendly and some what attentive but it definitely took awhile to place our orders in for our drinks, appetizers, and meals.  \n\nSince we were all hungry, I ordered us the nachos.  They were AWESOME.  Very happy and pleased with that selection. My sister ordered pretzels which were pretty good,but the clearly had TOO much salt on them.  The cheese dip that came with the pretzels however was AWESOME.  Definetly pleased with our selection.\n\nWe placed our order, which came out in a timely fashion.  Everyone was pleased.  The prices for the meal were about average for everything that you got.  I got the the margarita pizza which was pretty good.  My wife got jalpeno burger with fries.  My son got the kids pizza.  My sister and her husband got the seafood taco with shrimp and crab i believe.  The best part of this place is that they brew their own beer here.  Everyone got a honey beer (can\'t remember the exact kind) but it was 7.75 for 25oz which was a fair price i think.  \n\nAll in all, its def a place worth going.', positive, 0, 1
'Good beer, food and service. Arrived on a Wednesday night for business and sat at the bar. Bartender was attentive and nice. Food was great. I had the Bison Prairie Burger.

'The food is always plentiful, the atmosphere lively, the service friendly, and even though it\'s always busy, I rarely have to wait for a table. \n\nIf you\'re a nachos fan, this is the place!

Yes, it\'s that big. \n\nEven though I\'m not a big beer drinker, I enjoy their sampler, and I LOVE their cider; it had just the right amount of kick.', positive, 0, 0

'I\'m visiting Homestead this week for some work-related training.  Rock Bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel, and I\'m so glad it was!  I\'ve been there twice already and will go back before I leave in a few days.  I sat at the bar during both of my visits, and the bartenders were both very nice...Bob during the day and Paul at night.  The pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome.  Like other reviewers stated, the nachos are great!  I think the best part was that everyone was very friendly.  Other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat, which is so nice when you don\'t know anyone in the area!  Great place!  Thanks for the hospitality!', positive, 0, 0
'Very disappointing menu. Pseudo Mexican and south of the border fare. I had the Beef Tip Sliders. What a ridicules offering. Each one (2 on a plate) had a nickel sized piece of beef on an oblong  3\" bun. It was taken back to the kitchen, after I complained, and a thin sliver now appeared. The only thing good about this experience, the waiter was nice!\nAs the raven said, \"Never, never more.\"', negative, 0, 0
'We stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to Improv. My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite. We raved about it all night long. Our friend got a burger and asked for it well done. It came out medium. So she sent it back. The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had. \nI had the beer sampler and I liked all six beers. They were good. \nI would recommend this place and if we are down that way I will definitely go back.', positive, 0, 0

'I\'m very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill. While my boyfriend and I use to really enjoy coming here, the food has gotten considerably worse. They\'ve taken many things off the menu we use to enjoy, such as the pretzel sticks with beer cheese, and replaced them with frozen ballpark pretzels and nacho cheese. Tonight I ordered a steak salad, of which the steak was good, but there was nothing on the salad that was listed on the menu. Not to mention the whole place smells smells like dirty mop water. The beer is still very good, that\'s why still gave them 2 stars.', negative, 0, 0
'We were a party of four. My wife and I ordered the stuffed pepper. It was very spicy with some serious zip. However, it was delicious. My youngest son had the chicken enchiladas. He thought that those were the best that he ever had. My oldest son had the chicken mac-n-cheese. He thought that it was very good. We all shared the calamari and jalapeno appetizer-- very spicy, but very good. We also had the buffalo wing appetizer. The sauce was very good, but the wings were OK. The brownie dessert was a little disappointing. The brownies were dry. I also had the key lime dessert. It was OK. The service was outstanding. The atmosphere was vibrant and enjoyable. We will definitely return the next time that we are in Pittsburgh.', positive, 0, 0
'We stopped into Rock Bottom for a late dinner. The place was hopping-the bar side and the restaurant side. We chose to dine on the restaurant side. There were a lot of great choices on the menu. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich which had barbecue sauce, bacon, cheddar cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. The chicken it self had a great grilled flavor. I think it was good enough to eat plain. The barbecue sauce was smokey with a hint of sweetness. The pickles added a tangyness. It was a huge sandwich. It was served with fries but they were a little soft. They needed a few more minutes of cooking. \nI only ate half of my sandwich so I would have room for dessert. They have a couple of smaller desserts that are served in Mason jars. Then they have a few that are larger that you could share with 2pr 3 people. I ordered the cheesecake with caramel and toffee. Yum!!!! It was the perfect ending to a good meal.', positive, 1, 0
'Ergh, this place. I hate giving bad reviews but on my latest visit, I should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here. Naturally, I\'m not a stranger to this chain, understand it\'s a chain, but the past visit here was just not good.\n\nCame with my brother on a Sunday after a driving lesson. We were hungry and this was his way of paying for gas money. We were seated in the dining area. Every time we are seated in the dining area it\'s a bad experience. On the bar side you get entertainment, the beer flights/draft specials are decent and the bar food/appetizers are passable.\n\nIt started off with the soft drinks. I\'m not a pop drinkers so when I want a simple diet pepsi I expect it not to taste funky [and yes, I prefer the weird twang of diet drinks to sugar in a glass taste of regular]. There was incorrect carbonation, whether they were running out [I suspect this], no ice [lukewarm] or they had just hooked up a new box [unlikely]. I sent it back.\n\nMy brother got a burger which he said was fine, it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied. I tried to steal a few of his fries, which were a failure. They tasted like the off brand in the freezer section [a full mouth of starch], and were barely crispy enough. So abandon plan. On my own dish I had the classic mac n\' chicken. First of all, the pasta was crispy?, really?, it wasn\'t a cheese sauce, it was pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in Parmesan and smothered in breadcrumbs. And when I say smothered here, this is not a good thing. Sigh. The chicken was pushed to the bottom of the pan, which my brother tasted because I was turned off my this version of my favorite dish, and said it was cooked properly. A small save? \n\nAgain - I sent it back after about 3 bites. The waitress came back asking if I wanted a box, I told her to take it away. She did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check, which I didn\'t see as my brother paid for it while I used the restroom, I hope they didn\'t charge us for the pop drink.... Needless to say, I came home hungry. \n\nHonestly, if you come, come for drinks and a salad, they don\'t screw those up. Everything else, avoid.', negative, 0, 0

'A friend and I stopped in to Rock Bottom Brewery before a movie on a cold Thursday.  It was a short hike from the theater, but I am not cold tolerant, and was glad of the warm, comfortable restaurant interior.  It was pretty empty (my favorite), and we were ushered to a booth, which was roomy and comfortable.  \n\nOur server was friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations.  The beers were very tasty!  Even though we were starving, our server recommended getting 1/2 order of nachos if we planned to get dinner.  GOOD TIP!!!  The half order of nachos is piled on to a traditional dinner plate, and it was plenty of appetizer for 2 people.  My friend got the country fried chicken with mashed potatoes and slaw.  She seemed to enjoy it.  I got the veggie pizza with feta, which was good, but I think I would have been happier with something else.  There was no fatal flaw in the pizza, I think I was stuck eating bread with grilled veggies and feta while my friend ate fried chicken- and that was entirely my fault. \n\nOverall, this was a positive experience.  It has a \"chain\" feel (because it is a chain), but I would go back and recommend it to others.  It is for foodies? Nope.  It is amazingly original?  Nope.  But it is good food, good beer, good service, and a fair price.  Definitely.', positive, 1, 0
'first bad experience at this place. double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make. I asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt. instead of caramelized onions, they added raw onions. they should check the quality of jalapeños they use, it was not hot at all. they also forgot to add mayo.\nohh and they took 50 minutes to prepare this burger, and we missed our movie at amc. \nthe waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay. won\'t visit again.', negative, 0, 0
'Saturday night, Valentine\'s Weekend around 7 pm - Larger tables sat quicker from what I could tell when we were waiting. I was with one other person and we waited upwards of 50 minutes for a table. When we were finally sat it was by the door where it was really drafty. It was below freezing out, and we were both really cold. The food was great though when it came, and it somewhat warned us up. We ordered the tortilla soup, nachos, Diablo pizza, and 2 am burger. The soup was delicious. I\'m itching to have another bowl already. I also tried their darkest beer that had hints of cacao and peanut butter. I\'m not a beer fan, but I really liked it. Our waitress was extremely nice as well. We were comped 20 something dollars when we didn\'t even complain or say anything. It was a nice surprise when we got our bill. I\'ll definitely be back.', positive, 1, 0
'We waited for almost an hour, while groups smaller and larger, who had arrived both before and after us, streamed in and out. When we checked on our table status, they only replied \"You have 19 minutes\" to wait. I guess it didn\'t matter that I could see tons of open tables if they have some sort of seating timer. Once we were seated, our waiter was quick but that\'s just about the extent of anything nice I have to say. The other folks in our party mentioned that the burgers were pretty good; however, my Cuban Cristo was a mess. It had too much batter and was fried too long, resulting in a greasy, brick of a sandwich. And, for a brewery, I was extremely disappointed by the small size of their beer list. Overall, it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food. I won\'t be going back.', negative, 0, 0
'We got here at the last minute last night before the kitchen closed, there were five of us, and we got right in and had awesome service. We tried two beer flights so we could have the entire beer menu. The flights are priced exceptionally well. We had the nachos for an appetizer, which were good but not the best I\'ve ever had. I had the Brewer\'s Cobb, which has always been amazing at every Rock Bottom I\'ve ever been to and an extraordinary amount. My husband had the beef tips, which tasted good but didn\'t have a lot of meat. It left him wanting more. The mashed potatoes and onion straws paired with the tips were good though. The atmosphere was great, it was clean, and our server was friendly and attentive. Very happy with the experience.', positive, 1, 0

'The experience was different the second time around. We asked for a booth and got one right away. When we sat down, the waitress came fast and serve our drinks and appetizers fast. The food was great until the steak and shrimp came with the broccoli. It was not good, the broccoli was burnt bad and I ask medium well and they sent it bloody. My boyfriend\'s bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back. They sent the burnt broccoli back and I got a great salad, the steak had to go all the way to well done, but I believe the grill is not being clean properly cause the steak tasted burnt and charred. So the manager came over and ask my boyfriend if he wanted something else, he didn\'t and he asked me how he could make it better, I asked that next time could we have are food done properly cooked. He apologized and actually looked out with discounting the meal and gave us fresh spinach dip, which I enjoyed.

'Although the proximity to my house adds convenience as a factor in going to Rock Bottom, the food is less than desirable. \n\nThe beer there is great, it\'s a fairly clean establishment with a good wait staff, but the food IS AWFUL. I ordered the quesadilla appetizer, and for $10.59 I got 4 mini tortillas, not toasted at all, with some melted cheese and chicken. No salsa, no lettuce, guac, sour cream.  NOTHING. \n\nThen I was hoping the pizza I ordered would sort of redeem our experience, I got their \"hot\" style pizza since I like spicy food. The small pizza probably had 8 jalapeños worth of peppers, and then some sauce and cheese. It was so underwhelming. I wish the food could match the quality of their beer.

'A group of eight of us came here because Burgatory couldn\'t seat us (big surprise there) and none of us had been at this location before so we were willing to give it a shot.

It wasn\'t the best burger I had ever had, but it certainly wasn\'t the worst.  It satisfied the craving I had and that was really all I expected.\n\nThe reason I\'m giving this place a four star is the beer.  I had the High-Level IPA and it was fantastic.  Rock Bottom is know for its beer and they did not disappoint.  Everyone in our group that had beer was impressed.\n\nDon\'t go to Rock Bottom necessarily expecting the best food you\'ve ever had and you won\'t be disappointed with the experience.

'I have a little bit of mechanical knowledge, but not enough to land me a job as a mechanic. I try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanics. \n\nI called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my 05 Grand Cherokee. Alan (owner) quoted me $250 per side (I have the 5.7 V8, so there are 2 sides) to fix it. Sure enough, it was $250 out the door. Alan is a great guy that knows his stuff. If it doesn\'t need to be fixed, he\'ll tell you it doesn\'t need to be fixed. BUT, if it does need to be fixed, it really does need fixing. He even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects I plan on doing on this Jeep, which he didn\'t have to do. \n\nI chose to give Master a shot after my normal go-to shop in Monroeville didn\'t return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold. Some of the reviews on Google for Master are unfair, with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities. If you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done, fine. Just make sure you know what you\'re talking about. If you have zero mechanical knowledge, don\'t tell the mechanic how to do their job. Alan won\'t blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand. If you want your car fixed, take it to Master. \n\nThanks again, Alan, for giving me the opportunity to boast on the Jeep forums about only paying $250 for a repair that many have shelled out $1K+ to fix!

'The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.\n\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \n\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \n\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn\'t already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18\% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren\'t even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18\% even though I typically tip well over 20\%.    \n\nOverall, I don\'t like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.', negative, 0, 0
'The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\n\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you\'d think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it\'s an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\n\nIt\'s too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\n\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They\'re very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I\'d consider reasonable given the quality, and I\'d begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You\'re forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn\'t want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I\'d rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\n\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\n\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn\'t have prices on them.  I know this isn\'t uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it\'s an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It\'s not that hard.\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\"  I\'m calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you\'re trying to trick me.  It\'s kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one\'s customers.\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don\'t come with free refills, the servers shouldn\'t ask \"would you like a refill on that?\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \"would you like another one?\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \"we don\'t offer refills, but I\'d be happy to get you another one.\"  Just because there\'s a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn\'t mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don\'t even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.', negative, 3, 0
'My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18\% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.', negative, 0, 0
'We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife\'s work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn\'t any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down puréed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn\'t taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn\'t make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn\'t edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren\'t coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn\'t even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \n\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \"event\". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I\'d rather be there...how I\'d rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I\'d rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I\'d rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\n\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\n\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that\'s the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I\'d steer clear of those. Unless there is a can\'t miss type of comedian here, I can\'t ever picture going back to the Improv. I\'d give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.', negative, 2, 0
'This was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful. \n\nThe servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. \n\nThe only reason it isn\'t 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn\'t be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late.', positive, 0, 0
'I have been here twice in the last month. It\'s a pretty great time. My first visit, the service was pretty poor and the food was cold by the time it got to the table. We had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian was not that good (although that is no fault of the club). But when I went to the second show, the service was much improved. The burger I ordered was fantastic and warm. Our waitress kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage. We were also able to sit in the front this time and it was a great experience. I\'ll be going back soon!', positive, 0, 0
'Good! I can\'t comment on the food or the bathrooms, but from what experienced it was great! The drinks were decent, and I  believe you must order two items at minimum. The staff is quick, but they should have more people working on a Saturday night. Before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen.\n\nThe comics we saw were funny as well. Will definitely go back!', positive, 0, 0
'I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him.  That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven\'t... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.\n\nSo I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...\n\nSo the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  \n\nThe one or two things I didn\'t like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.  \n\nI would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!', positive, 1, 0
'It isn\'t often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to see the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn\'t offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she\'ll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! \"What about our food?\", we asked. \"Oh\", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That\'s all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was \"do you want me to take your food back?\". Really?!?! \"Do you want me to take your food back?\" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don\'t want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn\'t want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn\'t get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don\'t know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you\'re interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine\'s Day.', negative, 0, 0
'I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren\'t cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!', positive, 0, 2

'Absolutely loved it at the Improv! I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn\'t enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn\'t disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn\'t like was that an employee takes your tickets while you\'re waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back! It is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter!', positive, 1, 1
'So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had\nMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fiancés chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible, in fact, she didn\'t eat more than 3 pieces of it. Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better.', negative, 0, 0
'It\'s sad that this the only place locally to see national comedy acts (other than the big \'uns in the Cultural District). I hate this place\'s M.O. The space itself is fine...only a few blind spots, nice intimate venue. They bring decent acts in, although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts. But the two item minimum just infuriates me. Overpriced, shitty food and drinks. We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night (hilarious show, very nice guy, signed our CD and posed for photos with people). We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 Yuengling drafts. The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40. Burgatory is right down the street. Hell, TGI Friday\'s would have been better. I\'ve been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality.  The Improv\'s saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets.', negative, 1, 0
'Went to see Bret Ernst (one of my fave Comedians).  Tickets say seating begins at 9pm for the 9:30pm show.  Well, a line had formed outside because they hadn\'t opened the doors.  That is all well and good if it is summertime but it was 4 degrees.  People stood out there upwards of 20 minutes, freezing.  They didn\'t let people in because they claimed the room was not ready.  Seating is first come, first served.  Whoever designed this place should be shot.  There is no lobby to hold people before a show.  The Improv in Cleveland is superb.  That location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you.  The Pittsburgh Improv is a disaster layout-wise.  Beverage service was fine.  It got really, really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show.  Of course Bret and Bill Crawford were as hilarious as ever but man, this Improv, as a comedy venue, sucks.', negative, 3, 0
'Nice little venue for quality fun.  I saw Greg Warren here last night and had a really good time.  \n\nCheck out yippit.com or sign up for Goldstar.com before buying tickets at full price. You can usually find substantial discounts for shows on one of those two sites. Sure there\'s a two drink minimum but I\'m thinking that it helps pay for the comics and helps keep the price of admission down.  When you think about it, it\'s really a win-win.', positive, 1, 1

'Came here for a show last week with my family and had a good time.  Our opening acts were not the best, but the headliner brought some good laughs from the crowd.  When we arrived the man taking tickets was very friendly and okay with the fact that 2 members of our party were not with us. We just told him what they looked like and he let us go through anyway.  \nWhat happened inside next was what I thought would lead to bad review.  We were a party of 5 and they have mostly 4 person tables and then long booth benches with cocktail tables in front of them.  Our host tried to seat us at a 4 person table with a 5th chair on he end only to have a very rude waitress come up and say we couldn\'t do this. Our host then said \"she\'s your waitress and you\nDon\'t want to make her mad already\". They then tried to seat us in between parties on the booth bench against the back wall which with large men in our party that was not okay.  We decided to move to an end table and try again with a 5th chair and the waitress in this area was fine with it and extremely friendly. She saved the review! The drinks were fine, the wine list in not great but for comedy club drinks it was expected.  Kudos to our waitress for being accommodating and pleasant, just wish they were all.', positive, 0, 0
'Went for the first time last night and despite some of the iffy reviews, we had a great time. All of the staff was friendly, from the host at the front to the other staff and the wait staff was attentive (but we didn\'t get food, so I can\'t speak for how quickly ordering and getting food would be). Prices for drinks are a bit much, for 4 small drafts our check came out to about $50, but I did snag tickets on Goldstar for $10 a piece so I feel like it probably balanced out and the 3 comedians were great so I won\'t complain. I will say the food didn\'t really look all that great in comparison to the prices, but I can\'t speak for how it tastes. Overall, it\'s a fun place, no issues, I\'d go again.', positive, 0, 0

'Let me preface this by saying, I generally compare all grocery stores to Publix, maybe even Kroger. That being said, the one thing Giant Eagle (GE) has going for it is the quality and selection of items. There is no question that it has everything you could want. That\'s where the praise ends. Let\'s just do this numerically...\n\n1. Prices are outrageous. If you walk 100 yards over to the Target next to it, you\'ll find some of the same items for 30-40\% cheaper. A bag of Gevalia coffee is $7.99 at GE, the same coffee at Target is $4.99. And it\'s not just coffee, and not just Target. Giant Eagle has little other grocer competition in Pittsburgh. This being the case, if you\'re not near an Aldi\'s, Target or Walmart, you have to go to GE for stuff. They\'re banking on this lack of competition. \n\n2. Parking lots are thrashed every day, all the time. Now, maybe you don\'t care. But when I go in the morning, they\'ve been open maybe 30 minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building. They clearly don\'t bring them in at the end of the night. They also rarely have any small baskets near the door, you\'ll need to hunt for one. It\'s just laziness and a lack of care, on both accounts. They don\'t care about the appearance of the outside, nor the convenience for the customers. \n\n3. I don\'t normally mind the self-checkout, but only if I have a limited number of items. If I need a full grocery order, I\'m going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers, on a Saturday. The lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious. I\'m already paying exorbitant prices, but I also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too? Walmart doesn\'t even make you do that!\n\nSo that\'s about it. If you don\'t mind paying much higher than average grocery prices, ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer, than Giant Eagle in Waterfront is awesome!', negative, 0, 0
'This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it\'s a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there\'s no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE\'s I\'ve been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don\'t take your dry cleaning here.', negative, 0, 0

'This is a review of the Pharmacy. After having them screw up a third time I felt that others should know that this is a pharmacy to avoid. The first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of Synthroid, about 1/10th of what I needed. I ended up so sick after 2 weeks of taking too little that I was half dead before the problem was caught. Their response when I told them was to say \"oops\" and \"it won\'t happen again\". Not even a sorry, and it never did happen again b/c I went to Costco after that. This latest time was classic. I came with a simple scrip. Costco was closed so I went to Giant Eagle. After 45 minutes the finally inform me that they can\'t fill it b/c the scrip isn\'t specific enough (it was for a common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn\'t bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner, just made me wait and wait and wait until I pitched a fit to tell me that they couldn\'t fill it. It was late and I went to Rite Aid in Sq. Hill with the same exact scrip and they had ZERO issues filling it quickly. WTF? How can it be easy peasy at Rite Aid but Giant Eagle can\'t even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out? I wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all. It seems like they aren\'t even staffing the pharmacy with trained techs, just random people off of the street. \n\nDon\'t waste your time, or risk your health.

'I personally like this giant eagle. I dont think i\'ve given any GE 4 stars, so thats saying something. \n\nI should start by saying that i live in southside, so most GE\'s are equal or worse than that location.  The waterworks location is decent in my book. They sell beer, they have a cute little cafe sitting area, they sell \"meals for 2\" in their prepared foods section, produce always seems great, cashiers are friendly ect. The location seems pretty large. I also like how there are 2 entrances (one at pharmacy.) The parking lot is pretty large so it helps having another entrance for cold or rainy days. I am at this location alot more than the southside GE since my gym is in the waterfront. It makes it easier to get everything done in one plaza.\n\nI can\'t hate on this GE.

The downside is the chairs aren\'t super comfortable (to me) and the cafe is usually packed with people. I wish they had more seating options around the store.\n\nIt\'s a convenient location to come in and kill some time like others have mentioned. There\'s a lot to find in there so come back and browse!', positive, 0, 0

'Went to Barnes and Noble Waterfront with 3 books on my list.       First one there were several books by the same name so they wanted the name of the author.  Went to look it up on my phone.....Barnes and Noble wifi had blocked me.  Wanted me to sign it and allow them access to my information....NOT.  Long story short they only had one of the 3 books I was looking for and it was $4 less on Amazon....Lost this customer.', negative, 0, 0
'Their food is amazing. They have a deal that you can get a soup and salad for 6.95! Also they have drinks from Starbucks and deserts from the cheesecake factory. What I\'m eating right now is the tomato caprese which is delicious and their soup which is homemade chicken noodle soup which is awesome and the tiramisu cup which I never had before. You should try it if you\'re in the waterfront in homestead.', positive, 0, 0
'I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \"The Hangover\" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I\'ve seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It\'s spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you\'ll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob\'s long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don\'t remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie\'s I\'ve been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I\'m being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It\'s probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn\'t that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you\'re more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.', negative, 2, 0

'I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\n\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn\'t even realize our food hadn\'t arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn\'t). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn\'t have noticed that that WASN\'T what they ordered? Seriously?\n\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn\'t have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\n\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That\'s because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.', negative, 2, 0
'Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.\n\nRemember when you\'d go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you\'d go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can\'t describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\n\nI can\'t say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\n\nNow here comes the bad:\n\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\n\n2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.\n\n3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can\'t totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I\'ve played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\n\nIt\'s sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again.

'We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.

After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don\'t know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong..

'I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\n\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThis is probably the first place I\'ve been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \n\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough.

'I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I\'m sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact.

'This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \n\nI only had appetizers here so I can\'t really judge them for their entrées, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don\'t know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain.

Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \n\nIt\'s expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it\'s very easy to duplicate at home. It\'s equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \n\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that\'s not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square\'s location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\n\nI\'m eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.', negative, 0, 1
'I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.', negative, 0, 0

And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don\'t qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there\'s cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they\'re just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie.

I tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality.  The tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle.  They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale (it\'s the last week in April now). I knew that if I ordered that draft it would be quite stale as it\'s probably been in there for 6 months now, so I got a Southern Tier instead which was good.  The service is ok but rather slow.

Everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into Bar Louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table.

We ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minutes and our order was messed up. We tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out! He didn\'t get out of the weeds for the 2 hours we were there. Very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part.

'Sign stated \"Seat Yourself\" so we should have know the service would be horrible from the moment we walked in.  We originally sat upstairs, which was open per the sign.  After 20 minutes we got up and went outside. After 20 minutes outside and after the waitress taking care of and making small talk with the table next to us, we said screw it and walked.  The one other time that I had been there the service was so-so.  I will never go back.  Why should I have to try to track people down to pay for a meal?!?', negative, 0, 0
'Should have checked the reviews before we went. I\'ve been to \"real\" Bar Louie\'s in other cities. This is not one of them. Was seated for 20 min and no wait staff came to take our order. Several of them made eye contact but did not feel the need to ask if we had been waited on. Awkward. Then someone came over with two plates of food trying to serve us. We thought, here was our big chance to get served, but no, she just walked away. So we left. There are so many restaurants where you can get burgers, just go someplace else.', negative, 0, 0
'Was there for Saturday dinner at 6pm and still had some seats opened.  We sat down right away.  You sat yourself and menu was at the table.   Very casual place, yet family place.   A little noisy so not for date nights.  A little bit sports bar like but not like Champs.  Food was great.  Had boneless chicken nuggets (el fuego).  Side salad was very good.  I had verde chicken pasta and my husband had cod skewers with shrimp fried rice - I had some and it was delicious.  Clean bathroom- very important.', positive, 0, 0
'I just walked into Bar Louie while we wait for our table at Burgatory. We sat down at the bar and one bartender half acknowledged us and said he would \"be with us in a minute\". We continued to sit there and wait. While she talked to other employees and walked around the bar to talk to the servers. The only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar. When she finally did make her way to our end she greeted the people who just sat down and ignored us who had been sitting there for 7 minutes. This was NOT a busy time and therefore has no excuse for us having to wait more than 2 minutes for a drink. We got up and walked out and will never be back. I have never had a good experience with Bar Louie no matter where it has been. Their customer service is always subpar. Awful.', negative, 0, 0

'I love Bar Louie\'s happy hour. $5 martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread? Sign me up!  They also have a few other apps that  are part of the happy hour, but the flatbread is the one I usually get. \n\nThe melon martini is my current favorite, but most that I\'ve tried have been good.\n\nI don\'t recommend the shrimp appetizer. And I\'m not sure about some of the other food, but happy hour is 5/5 stars. The rest of the time, Bar Louie is probably a 3 star place. \n\nSo, if you\'re in the waterfront and are thinking of Bar Louie, go for the happy hour!', positive, 0, 0

'I went with some work friends before catching a movie later that night.  We got to Bar Louie a little over 2 hours before the movie started, which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done.  We had a table right away and the server took drink orders, but it took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  She then disappeared for 30 minutes before coming back to take a food order.  The food took almost an hour, and we had only ordered a couple appetizers.  The portions were really small for the price, and most of the food came out burnt.  I did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food.  Again, waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have.  \n\nThe place was busy, but not overcrowded, what I would expect on a typical weeknight.  There is no excuse for the poor service and food.  On top of that, the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently.  Maybe it was just an off night for this place, but I do not plan on going back again and taking that chance.', negative, 0, 0

'Sat at the bar at about 240 Saturday for appetizers and drinks. Not super busy but took over ten minutes for a draft beer and martini. Took 20 for appetizers. No offer to refill drinks or for water. Bartender was organizing glasses or drying glasses...passed us a couple times no eye contact despite empty glasses pushed forward. Others at the bar were also sitting with no drinks, no order taken, and I stress it was not full and the bartender was not busy making drinks. This is the second time this has happened at this location during the day when it\'s NOT busy. We will stick with Rock Bottom if we are at Waterfront during the day.', negative, 0, 0
'I enjoyed this place. I have avoided this location for so long. I gave it a shot tonight because of a work get together. Our servers name was Sarah and she was great! She was attentive and on her game. I had the \'Diva\' martini, which was very sweet and fruity. The bruschetta was good as well (however not traditional), served with a mix of tomato, onion, lettuce. The soft  pretzel sticks were your typical pretzel stick, however good, and served with three dipping sauces, honey mustard, a cheese dip, and a brown sugar/butter dip. The chips and salsa were served with three salsas, guac, regular salsa with a kick, and the cheese dip. The bar is clean. The food is trustworthy and not half bad, it is noisy, but that\'s is to be expected. It is a great place to watch a game, hang with friends and let go of work. The location is prime as well. Overall, a very pleasant surprise.', positive, 2, 0
'I made a reservation for 6 on a Saturday night. When we arrived we were told by one of the waitresses that they didn\'t make reservations for less than six.Then she changed that to six or less.  I asked to speak with a manager who told me they don\'t make reservations for less than ten.  They had no record of my reservation.  The manager was rude.  She asked if I had called the right location.  When I confirmed that I had, it was apparent she didn\'t believe me.  When I told her I had made the reservation about 10 days earlier during a weekday afternoon and had spoken to a gentleman, she told me they only had one male manager and he said he did not make the reservation.  I was told she could try and find something for us, but there was no way to tell how long that would take since it was a Saturday night.  We didn\'t stay to find out and have no interest in ever experiencing their brand of customer service again!', negative, 0, 0
'The food was ok. We ordered the pot pie soup but instead were given the tortilla. We didn\'t mind too much but the soup was way too spicy for me, and I usually like spicy food. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was decent. Nothing to rave about. It was just ordinary. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and bleu cheese flatbread, and I really liked it. I\'d suggest ordering that if you come here for a bite to eat. I also tried their Pinot Grigio, but it was in a very dirty glass.\n\nService was ok as well. It wasn\'t really busy, but it was steady. When we walked in no one was around the door and there were dirty tables everywhere. So we made our way towards the back and sat down at the only clean table. It seems like the waitresses won\'t clean the tables until after new customers sit down. After a few minutes, I noticed a table of two that were beside us. They were there before us but they had yet to be taken care of even after we got our drinks and ordered. All in all, this place just needs a bit of organization.', negative, 0, 0
'Valentine\'s Day! Terrible service. Waitress wasn\'t attentive at all which would be understandable if it were extremely busy but it was just steady. Food is overpriced for portions.

'I go here often because I work down in the waterfront, the staff is very friendly and nice. The drinks are very expensive but that\'s every Bar Louie. The one in homestead takes forever for food, the wait is ridiculous. I spent almost 45 minutes for some nachos. It\'s cool for a pre game and they have dollar burgers on Tuesday, and dollar brews on Wednesdays. It\'s very close to the movie theater so good for a date night!

'Bar Louie is my go to place in the Waterfront.  Consistently good food and friendly talkative wait and bar staff. Lots of wonderful specials but nothing tops Tuesday, dollar burger night, a Bar Louie tradition.  \nEspecially nice in the summertime when the garage doors come up, windows open and upper loft patio is full.  Flame pits are on the patio and provide warmth on a cool night.\nThe food is an eclectic mix.  Burgers are great as are the tots, get them loaded or better yet down them for speed :). Mussels are good, salads are great!  Appetizers are all excellent.  Try the Bavarian pretzels with quest or the calamari!  My favorite, especially on a cold or rainy day is their chicken tortilla soup.  If you give a green light to the cook, he\'ll spice it up to en fuego,  the way it\'s meant to be eaten. \nEndless refills of soft drinks allow you to sit and chat for as long as you like.  This is a wonderful spot to people watch on movie night or catch some of the Steelers who like to stop by.\nLove places that keep eating out fun.  This is a place where they remember your name!  Recommend strongly!!', positive, 17, 18
'What a delightful experience for this chain establishment. \nWe were in search of a place to dine outside on this perfect summer Friday evening. The sign said seat yourself and on 1st pass the only tables available were hightops built more fir standing with your adult beverages. This wasn\'t on this gals preferred list. We attempted the joint next door but waiting 90 min was an even I don\'t think so.... Back at  Bar Louie we went and scored a recently vacated table. \nMaria our awesome waitress greeted us kindly but have us some bad news... They were training new kitchen staff and it was taking a bit longer than usual for orders to come out.. But she assured us once they did they were as yummy and up to Bar Louie standards people have come to expect. \nOkay... Kudos, for letting us know in advance. \nWe ordered drinks and the food came out quicker than expected. \nI ordered the  Chop Chop salad and added shrimp to mine... Was done perfectly and the slice of garlic toast was a welcome addition. \nMy husband  opted for the savory Mac n cheese pork sandwich....my taste bite was scrumptious and lived up to maria\'s hype. \nGreat food...

'I\'m not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks.  I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year.  But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there\'s live entertainment.\n\nIt\'s hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There\'s even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.\n\nI\'m glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I\'ll get another chance to come back.', positive, 1, 1
'The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special! You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass. I signed up last year for this promotion and don\'t think I got the passes worth. \n\nThe waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though.\n\n1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. \n\nNext remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I\'m not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. \n\nIf you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won\'t use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \"I\'m an adult and you need to have some respect.\" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!\n\nSandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don\'t even care that I\'m getting splashed all the time I do realize that I\'m at a pool but it\'s hard to relax.\n\nIf you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you\'re trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I\'m looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer.', negative, 2, 1
'It\'s fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. The lazy river could be much better. I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location.', negative, 0, 0
'How many times do you get to fall at 70mph, wearing only shorts? Sandcastle can make it happen.\n\nIf you\'re going, it\'s best to stop by Giant Eagle and grab you some discount tickets from the customer service desk.  $25 is still a bit much in my opinion, but it\'s better than spending the full $30.99.\n\nThere isn\'t much I can think of that\'s in Sandcastle that isn\'t a great time, except maybe walking around and scorching your feet on the boardwalk.  I personally am a huge fan of some of the faster tube slides, and of course the massive speed slide.  If you\'re looking for a more relaxed ride, check out the Lazy River, or screw around in the big pool.  There\'s also a pretty nice wave pool there for your amusement.\n\nThere\'s also plenty of stuff for kids to do... But I don\'t have kids, so I don\'t know how all that is.\n\nThey do close at 7PM, which is a bit early, so be warned: you definitely want to show up earlier in the day.  BUT it\'s definitely a good idea to close the park if you can: right toward the end, the lines disappear, and you can ride over and over.  Win!', positive, 1, 1
'So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn\'t really know how to swim (... I still kinda don\'t. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\n\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\n\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you\'re on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you\'re going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \n\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\n\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don\'t want no pot belly. \n\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn\'t as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren\'t long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don\'t forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they\'re burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)', positive, 1, 0

'I LOVE Sandcastle. \nFirst, let me say that I\'m reviewing the waterpark, not the people. The park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave. \n\nIf you are going to visit, I would HIGHLY suggest you try to go on a weekday. I\'ve attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in. It gets CROWDED on the weekends, especially if the weather is nice. There aren\'t a ton of nice days in the summer in Pittsburgh, so when there are nice days, people come out in droves! \n\nThe slides are a blast, the lines are sometimes very long, but worth it. The lazy river is great when it\'s not wall to wall people. I really enjoy the new Dragon\'s Den but the line is CRAZY long for it! They also have a fantastic bar area, we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun!\n\nThey have several areas for smaller children, which are all fantastic. \n\nIf you are visiting, trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets, because these can get really pricey. You can also do a Sandcastle/Kennywood ticket, where you visit Sandcastle during the day and Kennywood at night. It\'s a fantastic deal, but boy could that be exhausting!', positive, 3, 0

'This was my first time back in about 12 years.  I haven\'t been here since high school so its hard for me to compare 12 years ago to now.  I do know the prices have gone up but i can remember paying $19.  I think the best thing you can do is purchase the tickets at giant eagle or even looking on the sandcastle website for deals.  My sister for a deal for 19.99 and day in the 2015 season.  I  paid 26.99 at my local giant eagle.  Thats not really a big deal.  \n\nI am definetly shocked that there was a $6 or $12 fee to park.. I mean its ridiculous we have to pay what we pay to get in and another fee to park is crazy.  We opted for the $12 fee to park real close to the entrance bc of having a 7 year old with us.  It is worth that extra $6.  \n\nI learned that you should get there and line up at the game fairly early if you want a good spot by the pool... People with plow you over and run to get a prime spot.  That is a downfall.  Plus this means that there are a lot of RUDE PEOPLE.  We got there early enough to ride all the rides we needed too.  we didn\'t do the lay river however because the lines were RIDICULOUS.  \n\nThe wave pool was a hit for my son but just watch all the people there.  People are rude there as well.  Some horse play and such. \n\nI must comment on the food, i def love potato patch fries but the prices are crazy... I ordered 2 chicken tender meals with fries and the costed me around 35 with drinks.  THATS is BS.  \n\nSandcastle is an ok place to visit, but its just not worth the money', negative, 1, 0

'My husband and I are season pass holders and try to make it out to the park once a week. I\'ve been coming here for about 7 years now and not much has changed. Most of the time we just hang out at the wave pool or relax on the lazy river. The food is good but I wish they offered some healthier options. They have a salad but that\'s about it. I\'m not a major crazy health nut but something non-fried would be nice. If your not too worried about the calories their food is delicious, a bit overpriced, but your at an amusement park so what do you expect. \n\nThis year they have also been slacking on cleanliness. I\'ve had to use the bathrooms a lot since I\'m expecting and I wish they would send someone in more often throughout the day. \n\nOne other reviewer mentioned an adult area. Sadly they don\'t have this, but I think it would be great!!!  I usually visit on the weekend since I work weekdays and having children bump into you and splash you everywhere you go isn\'t very relaxing. \n\nThe staff is great. I have never seen a more attentive group of people. They are always on alert and I have no worries about the safety of the children in my family visiting with me when they can. I also plan on being my new baby next year and I have no fears about his well-being. \n\nHere are a few tips if you want to save $$$. Pack your lunch. See park rules on cooler sizes and don\'t pack any glass. On weekends/holidays get there when they open if you want good seats or a seat in the shade. If you plan on going more then twice buy a season pass, it will save you time and money. If you ever plan on bringing guests get a VIP pass for buddy tickets, parking pass and a souvenir cup. Souvenir cups are good if you like to drink something other then water they save you a ton on refills and you can use them all season long. Bring flip flops. The pavement gets scalding hot. I burnt the bottom of my feet the first time I was there this year. If you plan on coming late a lot bring your own folding lounge chair. After the opening rush on busy days they are all gone in the first hour. If you plan on having a group of 5 or more renting a cabana is really worth it, especially if you have older kids. It gives them a place to always find you. And finally buy your tickets ahead of time. It\'s always more expensive at the gate then online or at a local retailer. You can even buy your tickets online while standing I front of the gate. They can scan your ticket off your smart phone. \n\nNote to other guests... Please watch your children and don\'t rely on the lifeguards to babysit them. They are your responsibility. The lifeguards are there to keep them safe and alive but not respectful. Also please be courteous to others and only put your towels on chairs your using. I was late arriving last weekend (got there at noon) and sat next to 2 perfectly good lounge chairs with towels on them while I sat on the grass. For 6 hours I never noticed 1 person use them. \n\nI hope this helps!!', positive, 0, 0
'For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. \n\nABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you\'re not sitting around all afternoon.', positive, 1, 1

Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? \n\nThese people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN\'T purchase from them, which blew me away. \n\nTheir professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who\'s in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.', positive, 2, 1
'The only place to buy a mattress.\n\nBoth my wife and I and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so I decided to check this place out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. Lee greeted us and showed us around the store. They offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. \n\nLee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy\'s and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.\n \nTake it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don\'t think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. \n\nA couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.\n\nI highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs.', positive, 3, 1
'I have been buying my mattresses and headboards from American Buyer\'s Discount Mattress Store for years. The selection is huge, the staff is extremely knowledgable and helpful.  There\'s none of the pushy sales tactics that you find at some of the other chain stores. They\'re honest and will make sure you get the mattress that\'s best for you and not their profit. The prices cannot be beat, the service is outstanding- free delivery and haul away of your old mattress. There\'s price ranges for every pocket book there and you can request financing too if need be. They carry all sizes and types of mattresses, daybeds and even lift chairs- those recliners that will lift you up to a standing position! If you\'re in the market for a mattress, bed frame, headboard etc. this is the only place you need to go! You definitely will be happy you did.', positive, 0, 0
'This is the most reliable car service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They\'re always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class. \n\nMy first time in Pittsburgh, when the driver heard I was on an interview, he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city.', positive, 1, 0

I tried these guys based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. \n\nI\'m a grumpy New Englander, and have been frustrated by the small town, easygoing/careless customer service at many PGH businesses.

'Ditto everyone else. I had out of towners needing to get to the airport but I had a last minute work conflict and couldn\'t drive them. I was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isn\'t great. I called these guys the night before an 8am pick-up and everything went smoothly. Dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather. If you\'re planning on getting a cab to the airport, definitely use First Class.', positive, 1, 1
'After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great. Driver was very courteous and on time.

My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn\'t going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. \n\nMy husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn\'t show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I\'d definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!', positive, 0, 0
'Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn\'t care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. \n\nJust when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. \n\nSo if you\'d like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!', negative, 0, 0

'Super classy business!! I needed to transfer 12 people from the PIT airport to downtown, and First Class wasn\'t able to help, because my group was too large.  The owner referred me to a competitor.  Wow, he could have easily told me I needed 2 or 3 of his cars, but he was kind enough to think of the customer.\n\nI was so impressed I did ask him how much would it be for a van (7 pax) and a car, and it wasn\'t that much more than the competitor\'s 14 pax van.  I haven\'t decided if I want to use 3 cars, or 1 car, but I\'m glad to know he didn\'t try to snooker me.\n\nClass act, and I hope that people will consider this company when hiring a vehicle.', positive, 4, 2

'Haven\'t been to TGIFridays for years and was never really a huge fan. I get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out. I must say that I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. I had the two for $10 lunch special with French onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. I was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so I opted for the French onion. It was okay but I think that I would get a salad instead of the soup next time. The chicken strips were wonderful and I am still craving them. The portion was huge and there were leftovers. My co-workers ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. The service was good and we had no issues.

The waitress, a \"professional\" , but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service, but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along.  Our food took a long time, and she \'saved\' herself by telling us that she didn\'t know why our food wasn\'t ready yet, but would check again, and of course, hot plates with luke-warm food came out soon after.

'Today we dined indoors after a bike ride on the rail trail.  I realized I\'d never been inside before, only out on the deck facing the trail/river.  While I love the outdoors and would always choose that first, it wasn\'t available today so inside we go.  This particular Friday\'s is nice inside with space between tables.  The one in Monroeville seems quite a bit more cramped.  \n\nThe purpose of this update is to brag about their burger.  OMG! This was the best burger I\'ve enjoyed for quite some time.  I\'ve been to specific burger joints that just simply try too hard and either I\'ve had bread components that fell apart immediately upon being held or various edible entities on the burger that just didn\'t go well together or overpowered the burger itself.  \n\nHere, I opted for the \"your call burger\" in which you select a cheese, a spread, and 2 toppings for 11.95 and it comes with fries.  I opted for Smoked Gouda for my cheese, the Truffle Aioli for my spread and Onion-Bacon Jam and Crispy Cajun Onions for my toppings.  Note that the spread comes on the side which is nice as I didn\'t use very much.  \n\nAgain, let me rave about it and tell you this is the best burger I\'ve had in a long time.  The burger was moist and juicy and well-complemented by the cheese/toppings/spread/bun.  I ate every morsel plus the fries plus a small side salad and was a happy diner.\n\nThat is all.

'I really don\'t know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can\'t find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we\'d at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn\'t even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they\'d actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I\'m sure there\'s still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you\'re listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don\'t know about?

The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don\'t understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald\'s has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\n\nFrench onion\nChicken bites\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\n\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don\'t get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \n\nI really never want to return.', negative, 2, 0

I didn\'t complain, it still tasted great.\n\nI\'m not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn\'t get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway.

'I would write anthems, poems, novels about their pizza. \n\nI\'ve dreamed of their pizza since I was a child. My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish. \n\nIt wasn\'t until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing I had ever experienced on this green Earth.  There was nothing I could compare it too. I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  \"No not personal...Regular.\" I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing. \n\nIt came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful.

Good view of the TV from any angle in the bar area (watching a Bucco\'s game at the moment) and the bar itself is full service. The Baked Stuffed Spinoccoli chicken that I had was delicious. I have no idea why I don\'t come here more often... I should!', positive, 0, 0
'The only reason to come here is because it\'s a fun place to eat. It sure isn\'t the food. \n\nToo much dressing in a salad that didn\'t even fill the bowl. Like so many before it, UNOs is making me leave hungry. It was a salad with Walnuts, Goat Cheese, and Blueberries, and while it was good, there was absolutely no value in this meal. One of these days I will learn to stop eating at big chain restaurants, kind of like not shopping at big box stores. \n\nIt\'s a nice atmosphere and generally crowded and loud. Some would call it fun and I think it is. But, sometimes it\'s worth a little extra to get what you really want and need in a meal. That\'s what adds value. \n\nIn the future these places will be relegated to the last ditch effort when nothing else is available. Only in a pinch.', negative, 0, 0

'Today was a good day at Uno. \n   When you join the Uno rewards program, you receive coupons and points. Today was kids eat free for the holiday. The kids menu has an make your own pizza option, which is always a fun activity for them. They also have a choice of a personal pizza(not a make your own), Mac and cheese, tiny Dino chx nuggets, kids sliders, and hot dog, and more. They also had a good choice of sides for them as well. Fries, grapes, broccoli, a side salad, and rice.\n   The lunch menu is what we ordered from today, which is a must when you go for lunch. They have a pick 2 menu with 3 pick options. $6.99 you can get a choice of endless soup bar with 4 different soups, and a choice of salads. $7.99 you get a choice of endless soup bar and either a pizza of the day or sandwich or a salad. And the 8.99 choices(I didn\'t make it that far on the menu for choices), I think it was a choice of salad and a choice of either pizza or pasta dish? \n   The kids personal pizza was about 8 inches and filling. The Mac and cheese was also big and had a side of a breadstick. Both choices were good portion sizes to fill my lil ones bellies. \n   The honey crisp chicken salad was a dinner size(it was big), with lettuce, tomato, red bell pep, onion, cheddar cheese, little crisps, and crispy chicken tenders, topped with a honey mustard dressing. It was a big portion and very delish. The 2nd choice was a personal deep dish pizza. Very good.\n   The soup bar today had minestrone, clam chowder, broccoli and cheddar, and tomato. All the soups at the bar were served warm and very tasteful. And the fact that they had tobasco at the bar, won my heart. The second lunch choice was a flat bread prosciutto and arugula. The flat bread was brushed with a garlic and oil, with mozzarella, then the prosciutto and arugula, red bell peppers and topped with a balsamic glaze! It was the regular dinner size and so yum for half the cost!\n    The amount of food they serve you for the lunch specials is beyond my understanding. I just don\'t know how they do it. The food was very good and the service was very good as well. This is a definite return choice for lunch again soon. Very pleased!', positive, 3, 3

'Was at this location a week ago and it was ok like any chain restaurant is until the bartender didn\'t wash her hands after leaving the restroom. My girlfriend took her daughter back and while in there the employee came out of the stall and walked right out the door.

'Strawberry Walnut salad was excellent - tender chicken, fresh strawberries and mixed greens, and perfectly sweet candied walnuts with feta cheese sprinkled throughout! The roasted eggplant, spinach, and feta flatbread also tasted fresh, which surprised me considering the short wait of 5 minutes or so. The entire dish was layered with thick slices of tomato, and I liked actually being able to taste the eggplant. The pesto sauce was prominent without overpowering the other elements of the dish. Well worth the $12 Pick and Choose price IMO. I did find a curly, black, and fine strand of hair at the side of the salad plate, so a small star off for that.\n\nI had a coupon for a free dessert,  so I asked for the mini chocolate peanut butter cup. It was good but not memorable. I liked that there were mini chocolate chip with the peanut butter though. I\'m not sure if the outer chocolate was intended to be rock hard or if the cold ice cream on it had simply hardened it, but it was extremely difficult to cut through with a mere spoon. For a free dessert, it satisfied me though. \n\nThe server, Christy B, was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal as well!', positive, 1, 1

'We woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place. We needed to go to the Waterfront for errands so we decided to have lunch there. It was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty. They say is in the back near the doorway to the kitchen. We were waiting and waiting for our waitress to come. During that time we realized that there was a child\'s birthday party 2 tables away. There were 3 tables of young boys and a table of parents. They were mostly well behaved but they were LOUD!!  Our waitress finally came and took our orders. While we were waiting for food there was a waitress standing right inside the kitchen door complaining about her day job. She went on and on about how bad it was and how she was looking for a new job. So in one ear I had a complaining waitress and birthday party in the other.  We were about to get up and leave when our food came. I had the Wedge Salad. It was ok but not something I would order again. My husband\'s salad, Italian Chopped, was better. It had a brightness that my salad lacked. IF I ever went back, and that\'s a BIG IF, I would order that salad. I had the personal size Chicago pizza. It had huge chunks of tomatoes, sausage, and cheese. For something that took so long to get it should have been hot. It was room temperature. I only ate half. My husband got the ziti with sausage. It was salty. I managed one bite and was done. My husband has a higher tolerance for salt so he was able to eat it. What we came away with from this experience is to leave. Don\'t try to stay when the experience is that bad. We were throughly disappointed.', negative, 2, 1
'It\'s basically the only Chicago style pizza in the Burgh. Not having had authentic Chicago style pizza, I don\'t know how this chain\'s pizza compares. However, the pizza is decent. The crust is thick and buttery and the toppings are abundant. However, don\'t be fooled, they serve up much more than pizza and sometimes, it\'s nice to have that variety when you\'re coming with a large party and when not everyone wants pizza. \n\nI like the versatility here with the varied menu. Sometimes, I don\'t even come here for the pizza. While the pizza is definitely the star of the show, their steak is also pretty tasty as are the sandwiches. \n\nThe food is enjoyable but the main reason why this is a go-to for me and my friends is because the service is usually very quick here. There rarely is a wait and the wait staff get us in and out right in time to make it to a movie. With food being rather consistent, it\'s hard to go anywhere else and chance the long wait times.', positive, 0, 2

I get them in the USPS, but why ask for email address then?\n\nUpdate*** I asked about the email coupons to the sales associate. She instructed me to call the number on the receipt to let them know I\'m not receiving. She also gave me a 20\% off coupon because mine I found online was only for online purchases.

Just a couple days ago, I couldn\'t resist Bath & Body when I saw their Semi-Annual signs posted out front. Not only did I purchase several candles and a car freshener for the bargain price of $30 total, but I was so impressed by the customer service.

'Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\n\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you\'re supposed to do. I know the ways I\'ve displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I\'ve slacked off. I get it, I really do.\n\nSo I\'m in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn\'t matter what time you\'re there during the sale, it\'s always busy. \n\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I\'m buying. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn\'t know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can\'t try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\n\nSo I\'m going through my stuff and separating what I want and don\'t want and she\'s sighing and grabbing things saying \"Soooo, you DON\'T want these???\" Um, I\'m not asking you to help me sort things. I\'m not holding up a line. I\'m just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \n\nAfter that, it\'s not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don\'t mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn\'t even want to deal with her). \n\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don\'t expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don\'t have to talk to anyone else ever.', negative, 11, 5
'Icy cold staff. I have never visited a store with such a bad staff. I went there to return a dress that I bought online. It didn\'t fit me and all the sales girls ganged up around me and looked at me so horribly, judging me continuously with their eyes going from my head to toe. \nAfter some time, they told me twice that it was such a cute dress while lingering on it like looking at their dead pet. I know it was a cute dress, the very reason why I bought it at the first place. It is not my fault that they don\'t have dresses in the store to try them on. Dresses are only available online. I had to wait for them to get over with their mourning and then someone to volunteer to process the return so I could get out of that store and breathe.', negative, 0, 0
'I usually have good luck at this store, and, aside from Goodwill, it\'s where I get my work slacks and jeans. I find there\'s a good classic to trendy clothing ratio here, so I can get a great white button up shirt or basic tees, and peruse the more trendy-ish items. There\'s always a great sale, and the salespeople are friendly.

'Within the last six months, Loft has become my go-to store for tops. My daily commute takes me by the Waterfront every day, so it\'s easy to pop into this location and check out their newest inventory. Loft does a great job of turning inventory quickly. Every couple weeks, the store has new product with a full clearance section. I\'m also signed up for the brand\'s emails so I know when promotions are going on. They offer 30-40\% off the store every month or so (generally around major holidays) and also offer 40-50\% off clearance pretty frequently.\n\nI enjoy the layout and store appearance much better than Ross Park and Robinson. Ross Park\'s store is very bland, and Robinson is currently in a temporary store. Shopping in an environment with bright fluorescent lights and boring white walls is just terrible, so I enjoy the Waterfront\'s pretty street-side location best.\n\nThe employees at this location are just OK. Sometimes I am cheerfully greeted at the front door but am generally ignored the entire time that I am shopping. I recently had a very attentive sales associate who opened a fitting room for me when my arms were becoming full, but I thought that I noticed someone with a District Manager vibe lurking around, which probably encouraged the associate\'s motivation. \n\nI actually had a very negative experience at this store during a recent sales event. The event ended at 7pm on a weekday, and I rushed to the store after getting off work. I hurried around the store and jumped into line at 7:02pm. All associates abandoned the registers at 7pm, totally ignoring me and the other two girls waiting in line. When I was finally helped several minutes later, the snippy associate told me that the discount may or may not go through... that corporate determined when the discount was turned off. OK, that\'s great, but then why did you totally ignore me and your other customers for several minutes? Did you want us to not get the discount? I was appalled by the rudeness of both the associate and a manager I spoke with earlier in the evening, who was equally rude about the sharp end time of the discount. What made the situation much worse is that a good friend of mine was a manager at Loft a couple years ago and told me that ringing up after 7pm would not be a problem. Hah, well it was a problem at the Waterfront location!\n\nThe only reason that I gave Loft 4 stars is because I love the brand, discounts, and quality of product as a whole. The staff at this location is sub-par and do not reflect the brand well. I hope that Loft does not lose customers based on negative customer service experiences.... They\'re lucky that I like the product enough to ignore some occasional rudeness.', positive, 0, 1
'I love this particular LOFT store! Everything is nicely set and the atmosphere is relaxing. The quality of clothes is really good and I do believe it\'s good value for money. They usually have more chic and classic clothes which I love. The staff is exceptional here. I love that they are really trying to help finding the right clothes for you instead of telling you \"how beautiful everything looks on you\". I always feel welcomed and I really do appreciate the fact that I am not being approached by a staff member every two minutes (this unfortunately happens in a lot of other stores in this area). This store feels more personal. Combine that with quality and affordable clothes and happy staff members and you definitely have a new regular customer!', positive, 0, 0
'When I lived in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang\'s was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu.\n\nHere in Pittsburgh, it\'s the only Chinese place I\'ve found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA\'s top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.\n\nThe Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.\n\nTheir fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don\'t quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.\n\nPortions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.\n\nIf you live in LA, forget P F Chang\'s.  If you live in NYC, I\'m sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  But here in Pittsburgh, it\'s just about the best place around.', positive, 0, 1
'I hate this place.\nIt\'s very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.\nIf you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They\'re quieter, with very good food & service.', negative, 2, 0
'Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang\'s has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don\'t know many other restaurants that go this far.\n\nAside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don\'t expect this to be at all like that.  It\'s not a Buffet.  They don\'t sell \"General Tso\'s\" (though Chang\'s Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it\'s my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  \n\nThe prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it\'s well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I\'ve yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.\n\nThe only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It\'s also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I\'ve been there for both.', positive, 3, 2
'REDO!\n\nI went to PF Chang\'s several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \n\nMy issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  \n\nMy resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.\n\nSo we returned to PF Chang\'s for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn\'t know what it was and didn\'t want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn\'t expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn\'t that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn\'t wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang\'s chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso\'s Chicken.  Now I have never had a General\'s chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn\'t good.  Chang\'s chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don\'t understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam\'s/Costco tastes better.', negative, 2, 2
'Honestly, I\'m furious. I enjoyed PF Chang\'s restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\n\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn\'t tell us when we would be seated.\n\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it\'s impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\n\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang\'s and the front office staff still couldn\'t tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.\n\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\n\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\n\nWe certainly will never visit PF Chang\'s again.', negative, 2, 0
'Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating\n\nGot there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \n\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn\'t even a line at this point.  \n\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.', negative, 1, 0

'Sadly I\'ve been here a few times because it\'s a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend\'s parents come down to visit. There\'s nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \"alright\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you\'re encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang\'s you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it\'ll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang\'s was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don\'t think I\'ve ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend\'s father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn\'t bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don\'t think I\'ve ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can\'t hide his bad day well doesn\'t really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it\'s soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it\'ll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.', negative, 2, 0
'My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang\'s and stay on a vegan diet.\n\nVegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps.

The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.\n\nThey also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.\n\nI always loved the fact PF Chang\'s offered brown rice.

'So I have never been to P.F. Chang\'s before since I\'m Chinese and I\'m not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren\'t in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang\'s a try. \n\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I\'m ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.', positive, 3, 2
'This was my first time at this PF Chang\'s and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy.

'I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but \nThere was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. \nOne of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. \n\nReservations:\nOur party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.\n\nAt 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....\n\nWhen we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who\'s fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.\n\nMy Hot and sour soup is usally served with\"noodley\" things that I drop in the soup. We weren\'t given any \"noodley \" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn\'t selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart.', negative, 2, 0

'I\'ve always liked PF Chang\'s and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.\n\nThe food is typical PF Chang\'s: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it\'s also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I\'m all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I\'ve always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \"Chinese\" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it\'s never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I\'ve tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entrées and have never been disappointed.\n\nI\'ve only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I\'ve gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I\'m not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn\'t in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would\'ve made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn\'t outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.\n\nThe only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang\'s I\'ve been to - is the insane wait that you\'ll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn\'t have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang\'s, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I\'ve yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang\'s, included.', positive, 1, 1

'Our last few visits have left something to desire, One of the things I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. These people look miserable, no one smiles or greets you appropriately, it\'s more like get in, get out, turn the tables,\n\nThe food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time JB and I came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (HINT, HINT) so we left and most likely will not be returning.', negative, 3, 0
'If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!!  We sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out.  She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar.  Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made.

She was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.

'I usually have fair experiences with this PF Changs. I\'ve been inside the restaurant, and have used the curbside to go service. I finally decided to review this based on my most recent experience.\n\nI can\'t remember her name, but whomever worked curbside to go on Oct 30, 2013 around 6:30PM deserves a mention. She was very nice, and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form. They\'re usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces! She also gave us a couple other sauces to try (not sure which ones), but these were very good. \n\nThe food here is always in point. I like to get the edamame, sesame chicken with brown rice, and the flour less chocolate dome! \n\nI\'m reducing a star because of past experiences with service.', positive, 0, 0

'Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy! Started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot! Lol. Tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave. Their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well... which is different bc you don\'t normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl.  By the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups, we were almost full. LOVE the way their Mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well. Definitely will be back because this place is clean, service is quick, food is delicious, and the price isn\'t so bad either.', positive, 2, 1
'We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband\'s dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(', negative, 0, 0
'Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\n\nSo... I thought I\'d try the chain PF Chang\'s Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn\'t too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang\'s Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang\'s. \n\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would\'ve been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\n\nI\'ve had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \"lunch-portion\" cost was $9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.', negative, 0, 0
'This is the fourth Changs I\'ve eat ate. It was pretty good. The food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. Had a strange texture.

Would eat at this one again.', positive, 0, 0
'Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac\'s Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.', positive, 0, 1

'I was a little peeved that the gluten free version of the Buddha Feast cost $10.50 when the regular version cost $9.50. So you\'re charging a dollar more to give me the gluten-free version of a veggie, tofu, and rice platter?? Regardless, it\'s worth it to get the gluten-free soy sauce (which I buy for myself and I know isn\'t THAT expensive). When my dish comes out, it\'s literally just steamed veggies and rice. No tofu, no seasoning or sauce. I ask why there\'s no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it. When I ask if there should be any sauce (aka flavor) to the dish I\'m informed I could\'ve ordered any other gluten-free dish\'s sauce to go along with it. Thanks for the info now...yes I\'ll take the GF beef broccoli sauce on the side. The sauce comes out and it\'s actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat, even though now I\'m extra annoyed at paying $10.50 for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldn\'t get flavor or tofu. \nTo top it all off based on how miserable I feel now, I\'m pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway!

The hostess and server were both friendly.  My husband enjoyed a glass of sake, and I had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious.  We split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer; they don\'t custom-make your sauce any more which is disappointing, but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves.  His Chang\'s Spicy Chicken (extra spicy) turned out great, and provided the extra requested heat.  My Orange Peel Shrimp were as good as I\'d remembered-- perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well.  We also ordered a Great Wall of  Chocolate.  If you like  chocolate cake at all, you\'ll love this one.\n\nPF Chang\'s consistently provides good Chinese in a trendy (but still casual) atmosphere at a decent price, and I\'m always a fan.', positive, 5, 4
'This is largely a review for Sean, a managing partner at this location. I had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays, looking for a non-cooking escape before getting inundated with guests. A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn\'t come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn\'t apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can\'t thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience. Heaven knows that a positive tone is ESSENTIAL going into the holidays with family!', positive, 0, 0
'If I had to use one word to describe my experience : Depressing. And even that is being generous.\n      I came in with two of my friends for new years eve before continuing on to the remainder of the evening. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. My friend and I ordered the Asian pear mojito, which was decent. My other guest ordered a jack and coke and was immediately depressed to discover that it was all jack Daniels and a splash of coke for color.\n   When we got to the table, we were hoping for a better experience. Little did we realize, we would suffocate while holding our breath. \n      We ordered the combination fried rice, described  containing egg, chicken, pork, shrimp, and beef. When it arrived to the table, the only egg that was present was the ones we were wearing on our faces.\n     We also ordered the honey chicken and the beef with broccoli and again hoped for better quality. There were no complaints with the chicken, the only star of this evening. \n      The beef was disappointing to say the very least. To start, the kitchen sent out Mongolian Beef, rather than the intended entree. When they refired the dish, and it was presented, it looked better than it actually was. Never in my life have I bit into a piece of beef and instantly fear cracking a tooth. The beef in the dish was tough, and crunched (again a new first for me). \n              It will most likely be a very long time before I return.

'Let\'s put the food aside here for a moment.  Let\'s talk about customer service for a moment.  Earlier this week, I had the misfortune of dining at the Waterfront P.F. Changs.  It was bitter cold outside. Their food is usually good, so my husband and I ducked in to get a bite before we went to the movies.  We were seated and we quickly ordered because we wanted to make our show time.  I didn\'t notice it at first, but I soon realized that it was cold in the restaurant. I asked about the heat and I was told that there was no heat - that it had broken earlier that day.  I asked our server why they hadn\'t mentioned this when we came in.  Well, I already know the answer to that - we would have turned around a gone somewhere else.  Then the manager came over and apologized.  I mentioned to him that it might have been nice to be warned about the heat (as I sat there in my coat).  He seemed to agree with me, but still allowed at least another 20 people enter the restaurant without saying a word to them. Not one word. Oh, he did offer me some dessert. That\'s what they usually do when someone has f**ked up.  In this case it didn\'t matter.  I quickly ate and left to make my movie.  This is the second bad experience I\'ve had at this particular location.  Last time I was there, the floor was pretty dirty which always makes me nervous.  What does the kitchen look like?  I\'m not against P.F. Chang\'s because it is a chain I have gone to in other states and have always liked the food.  This location needs to get their act together.', negative, 0, 0

'My girlfriend and I just ate here this was my first time eating at PF Changs but I had heard very good things about this restaurant.

My girlfriend got an appetizer of the edamame and the fried green beans the edamame was very Bland and needed seasoning the green beans were not spectacular although she did say that she enjoyed the sauce. for entrees I had the sweet and sour chicken I have had sweet and sour chicken from several other Chinese restaurants including take out and I was very displeased with the sauce and the poportion I\'ve had better for cheaper. My girlfriend had the chicken fried rice which was fine but it\'s also a very easy dish overall we rated this restaurant with one star because we did not even care to stay for dessert even though the desert did look appetizing.

'I reserved a car onilne via Enterprise\'s 800-number. I was told my car would be $57 for a three-day rental, including fees and taxes.\n\nWhen I got to the local office to pick up my car, I was told that I needed insurance. Okay, that\'s fine. The man at the desk told me the rate was (his words) \"Seven dollars a day.\" He said this at least twice. Over the course of the conversation, that became \"$25 for three days.\" I didn\'t think much of that, because \"seven dollars a day\" works out to close to \"$25 for three days.\" And when I got the actual receipt, it was $25 for EACH day. And as we all know, \"$25 for three days\" is very different from \"$25 a day.\"\n\nIn addition to that, my rental was a little more than the $57 I was quoted on the 800-number. Not much more, but enough to make it not right.\n\nSo, my $57 rental, plus $7/day insurance, should have been about $88. Instead, my total was about $129.\n\nBottom line, Enterprise can\'t be trusted. Not at this location, at least. I will never use them again, and plan to talk to the Better Business Bureau about their business practices when I return to town on Monday.', negative, 0, 0
'This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.', positive, 0, 0

But here\'s a secret - they don\'t seem to know what an Americano is so often I am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. Needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. Although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. Pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. There is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta.

Not knowing, nor doing my homework before I showed up, I asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not.  Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included.  After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted.  They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now.  If you would rather slice yourself, I am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way.  Yes, it\'s true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf.

I can only imagine this decision because they\'re known for print quality. They should also be known for being cumbersome and overcharging. After an hour of struggling with their machines to print, we left. I suggested Target because we were in the area, and I halfway remembered that they used the Kodak app to develop pictures from your phone. \n\nAs soon as we get in, it\'s always a win because pictures are 25¢, compared to 49¢ at their competitor. It was easy to sync up the photo library via wifi to the kiosk with the app. After choosing and modifying all of our pictures, we were given a slip stating our order of 63 pictures would be ready in 15 minutes. \n\nWe picked up everything else we needed and checked out, finishing in 7 minutes.

'Let\'s start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman\'s suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men\'s Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\n\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux\'s had arrived the guy answering the phone said \"Oh... I don\'t know\" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \"Let me check that for you\") he instead said \"Well, I\'m going to hang up now.\"  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we\'d get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \"I\'ll be unable to get to a Men\'s Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\" to which she responded \"Yeah that should be fine\" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men\'s Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \"Oh, that isn\'t for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\" \n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \"Effing Men\'s Wearhouse.\"  For example, at a restaurant, \"Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men\'s Wearhouse!\"  \"Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men\'s Wearhouse.\"\n\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \"I hope you\'re taking notes for your own impending wedding\" to which I replied \"Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\"\n\nCongrats Men\'s Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\n\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.', negative, 1, 1

'Let me start out by saying that my husband loves the MW at Westmoreland Mall, and even rented his tux there for our wedding without issue. Last year, he also rented a tux there for an out-of-town wedding he was in. After the wedding was over (the next day, before we returned home), we returned the tux to a MW at the local mall, also sans any issues.\n\nRecently, said husband got a promotion and bought some dress pants and shirts from MW at the mall, and was sent a $50 gift card. Last weekend, we decided to head down to The Waterfront....lo and behold, there\'s a MW in Homestead. Who knew? So, we head to MW to see if he can get something for free. Before we go in, I ask him, how much are pants normally at MW? He said, oh about $50 or $60. Okay, well the cheapest pair of pants we find are around $130, but most around $200?! I\'m shocked, never thought men\'s dress clothes were so pricey. Again, who knew? Surprisingly, we were able to sift through the sale racks and were able to find one pair of pants on sale for $19.99 and dress shirts for $14.99! Very exciting! \n\nThe problem was the staff and the store itself. First of all, the store was messy. Sales racks had clothes out of place and shirts rolled up, not a good impression for a \'high end\' men\'s clothing store, not to mention it was hard to look for sizes etc. with everything out of place.\n\nThe biggest issue was with the staff. There were five employees in the store. Okay, I get it, they work on commission, but seriously. The one and only employee who approached us, and I can\'t remember her name but she was a middle-aged Russian woman- was a shark! She asked if we need help, we both say no, we\'re fine. Just looking. I am much more assertive than my husband, however, which she realized right away. Needless to say, she wouldn\'t leave us alone. I tried several times - nicely - to tell her we were just looking around. My husband said, I\'m looking for some dress shirts and pants. maybe a tie. She just doesn\'t get it...keeps asking \"Do you want to look at more ties?\" \"We have nice blazers and jackets\" I\'m finally like, lady we\'re only here because we have a gift card, we don\'t plan on spending a ton of money. Getting her to leave us alone was near impossible. If it would have been me alone, I would have walked out. However, I knew my husband wanted to use the gift card.\n\nThe worst part is there were other customers in the store that no one was waiting on. Some of which were looking around for assistance. I didn\'t get it.\n\nContinuing on, check out was a nightmare! Each and every item rang up more than the price tag. She had to end up cancelling the sale and re-doing the whole thing. We had to carefully scrutinize every thing she rang up, to make sure we weren\'t overcharged. We ended up going over the $50 - obviously. So, she says, \"You can swipe your card there.\" I said, \"We have cash\" and omg you would have thought it was the end of the world. They had no money in the drawer and she actually had to send another employee in the back to get us change. \n\nLet\'s just say, I\'m sure my hub won\'t returning here anytime soon. You can buy nice men\'s clothing almost anywhere else for less money and less hassle. \n\nPros: None', negative, 1, 0

I do think it\'s a little expensive but I\'ve watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so I\'m sure it\'s justified.  \n\nSide tip, go in and get a slice of Pizza, it\'s a little different than their whole pizzas you order.  It\'s really good.\n\nOh yeah, be sure to ask for Longfellow Bones, he\'s a cook there and a hell of a rapper.  Tell him HITTofMCM sent you.', positive, 2, 0

'I have no idea why I\'ve lived close to this DSW for nearly a year and had never shopped here before! This week, I was looking for a very specific pair of heels, and DSW was my go to place. I found a fabulous name-brand pair at a great price. While browsing around, there was an associate who was slowly straightening shoes, but she made no effort to talk to or even smile at me (which is awkward because I smiled at her). Thankfully, the cashier was an extremely sweet and outgoing older lady, who encouraged me to sign up for their loyalty program. Though I didn\'t really need to sign up, she was so kind that I couldn\'t say no. I plan on going back very soon!', positive, 1, 1

I headed back to the clearance (unusual for me!) and wow, what a selection! Seychelles summer wedges for $14... Minnetonka suede booties for $50... Both the styles and the prices were spot on! I ended up purchasing a pair of Audrey Brooke summer wedges for $12 along with some Nina silver \"wedding\" pumps for $30. What bargains!\n\nHowever, I\'m not writing this review update to just talk about fab shoe finds and great deals...  \n\nThe first several times that I shopped here, customer service was dismal (as mentioned in my previous review). However, the last couple times I\'ve been here, I\'ve seen associates as soon as I walk through the door and been quickly offered assistance.

Which the response I got was to basically look on the shelf.  After I told them I did that already, one of the employees had an ingenious idea.  Instead of checking the kitchen part of the store, why not check the bath part.  What do you know, that\'s where it was.\n\nSo that just makes me think that they had this item at the other store, but just weren\'t in tune with knowing that the item was located in another part of the store.\n\nEverything after that was a smooth ride.

'Is it a Pittsburgh thing? Maybe so but that is no excuse for this crumby diner chain. The few times I have dined (if that\'s what you want to call it) at an E\'nP I felt like committing Sepaku (Hari - Kiri). I never got sick from the food but more disgusted with myself for stooping to this level of gastronomy. Nothing really worthwhile on the menu (maybe a burger- how much can you mess that up?). My gut just tells me not to trust E \'N Ps.  No offense to truck drivers of America b/c they keep supplies on our selves but It  reminds me of a truck stop restaurant without the truck drivers. I always seem to migrate to the salad bar and get weirded out for having to deal with the utensils that pick up the salad. So I wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff. The waterfront  E \'N P is perhaps the cleanest one I have been to but that\'s not saying much b/c the patrons are kinda off. So an extra star for this location. But it\'s not like I would ever say to my friends in NY, SF, London or wherever...\"Hey when you come to Pittsburgh be sure to go to an E \'N P to get the flavor of the city\".

'Ugh. I\'ve always been an Eat n Park fan, but this place was awful. It was a Friday night and granted it was pretty busy, but gawwwwwd. It seemed like every single employee was around 16 years old. The service was very slow. We ordered an appetizer platter and cheese fries to split. Easy enough, right? Well they didn\'t fry anything long enough so it was soggy and all the breading was falling off everything. My drink was never refilled. Even worse, we noticed ants crawling all over the window sill next to us!\n\nHalf an hour later the server decides to ask \"You gettin\' dessert?\" We ordered slices of pie to go. My \"slice\" of strawberry pie was two strawberries and a few crumbs of crust. We went up front to pay to find one lady at the register (who seemed to be the sole adult employee) counting her drawer and nobody else in sight. We stood there and evil eyed her for a few minutes and she finally took a break from her conversation to say someone would be with us. A few more minutes and finally the girl who was our server rings us up. I asked for a different, ACTUAL slice of pie, which she managed to get about five minutes later. Basically the whole experience was pure torture, which is disappointing.', negative, 3, 0
'I love eat \'n park. Whenever I come to Pittsburgh, I go to this restaurant. This area is great in the waterfront. It\'s so peaceful here. Pittsburgh is a beautiful city. Eat n Park has the best pie. I wish we have this at home. Their banana cream pie and their strawberry pie are my family\'s favorite. Their food is better than IHOP. They are so cheap. You can get a slice of pie for $3.  They have a variety of everything and they are clean. Their cheese fries, milk shakes, and their breakfast menu are great. Not everything is great on the menu but they have everything you can think of in a diner and the best part is they are open 24 hrs a day. If you\'re hungry in the middle of the night, they have a midnight menu. I like this location better than the one at squirrel hill. The waitresses are nicer and the food is better.

We only come here for brunch, and since I aint got no job and limited funds, it\'s pretty awesome to enjoy a brunch for two for under $20.  The unlimited house coffee is delicious, and I\'m not even a big coffee drinker (more of a tea aficionado myself).

'Yes, I know that it\'s cheap diner food, but c\'mon... You have your corporate headquarters within walking distance and this is all you can serve up? \n\nMy husband and I were craving a late night snack after seeing a movie a couple weekends ago and decided to try this Eat \'N Park location for the first time. I had always been adequately satisfied at other locations so I thought this restaurant would be worth a try.\n\nI ordered several items - Sweet Potato Fries with Apple Butter Dip, Hot Chocolate, and Pumpkin Creme Pie. I think my husband ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. Anyway, every item was problematic in some way. The fries were good, but the apple butter was oddly thick and sweet. The hot chocolate had \"creative\" chocolate syrup drizzling, that was running all down the cup and saucer. I had to carefully drink the beverage - which was OK - because I was afraid that I would get the syrup all over my hand, face, and clothes. The pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a 5 year old. It looked like it had been carelessly cut and plopped onto the plate, where it appeared very flat and unappetizing.\n\nHowever, our waitress was the sweetest, middle-aged woman! Our food took a little time to get to our table (not too bad though) and she comped two of the items (I believe the Hot Chocolate and the pie) from our bill. She was very attentive and kind while we dined there, and I made sure that my husband gave her a good tip. If I remembered her name, I would definitely mention it in this review.\n\nHowever, despite our kind service, I\'m not planning on returning to this location any time soon.', negative, 0, 0
'Went here on a Saturday night.  Despite being busy, we were seated quickly but unfortunately that was the only good part of the visit.  I ordered the buffalo chicken mac and cheese and after about 30 minutes, it arrived with dry burnt fries and \"toast\" that was not toasted at all.  The most egregious error was within the macaroni itself-- there was not a single drop of hot sauce in the dish whatsoever!  I waited about 15 more minutes until the server came back to tell her my dish was lacking a primary ingredient.  She asked if I wanted some hot sauce on the side to put on myself, but it had taken so long to deliver and for her to return to our table that the macaroni was stone cold and no amount of hot sauce would have saved it.  She took it back to the kitchen and brought me a new one, but didn\'t offer any sort of apology or compensation.  By the time I finally got to have a bite of my dinner, it was 55 minutes into our visit and my girlfriend had already finished her meal.  I could overhear people around us complaining about their food being incorrect or delivered to the table cold so I doubt I\'ll be coming back here any time soon.', negative, 1, 0

'We had a really nice Sunday brunch here today. It exceeded my expectations which were admittedly very low. We needed some healthy food options for our 1.5 year old as well as enough comfort food to satisfy our starving and lazy weekend bellies. \n\nThere was a short 10 minute wait for a table at around noon but the hostess was nice enough and they gave us a big, clean booth with a partial view of the river. It took another 10-15 minutes to get service although our waiter did pop by to say he would be right with us. Another waitress took our order in the end and they comped us for one buffet. So the three of us ate for the price of one since kids five and under get a free buffet with a paying adult. ($7.99)\n\nOk enough about the service which was slowish but it\'s a full house at that time so understandable . The food:\n\nThe buffet was constantly refreshed and each container overflowing with hot food. My favorites: really well cooked fried chicken perfectly salted and complemented with Frank\'s red hot sauce. Biscuits and gravy, the biscuits were a little dry, mini peirogies, cooked baby carrots, really nice mini pancakes, stuffing, bacon, and ok-only home fries. It\'s too bad cos I generally judge a place by the quality of their breakfast potatoes but in this case the fried chicken more than made up for it. My husband had some decent salad and good clam chowda.\n\nMy kid ate everything on the other end of the buffet: cherry tomatoes, cottage cheese, cooked baby carrots, cantaloupe and honeydew melon, pineapple, bits of peirogie and chicken. The waiter gave him a shamrock sugar cookie at the end of the meal. We helped him eat most of it :)\n\nThere were a few misses: French toast were disappointingly dry and hard and the buttery/oniony noodles were undercooked. Other things looked good but we couldn\'t try it all: mini-waffles, mash potatoes and gravy, sausage patties, cheesey sauce, scrambled eggs. We\'ll just have to go again in a few weekends.

'Eat n Park is usually decent.  This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.

Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  It\'s not.  Doesn\'t matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we\'ve had a stellar service, but it\'s few and far between.  Today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a \"closed\" section.  That server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  I\'ve never had this issue at any other EnP.

'Possibly the worst dining experience I\'ve had.  My husband and I were riding the bike trail in Pittsburgh and we decided to grab a bite to eat here since this location is right along the trail.  We noticed there were many tables open on the patio so we requested to sit outside.  It was rather busy inside so we waited patiently for 20 minutes until it was our turn to be seated.  The hostess then took us to a table inside the restaurant.  Not wanting to be rude, I asked if they were not putting anyone outside for some reason... She said the person who took our name didn\'t indicate that we wanted to sit outside (however, I watched her write \"patio\" next to our name).  We were then led outside and told to sit where ever we wanted... Because it was still basically empty... \n\nFinally happy to be seated, we waited another 10 minutes or so for our waitress to come.  She asked if we were ready to order both our meals and drinks so we did.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks which we quickly drank because we were thirsty from riding.  We were able to get a refill before we got our food since it took over 40 minutes from the time we ordered it.  The waitress came back one more time after we were done eating and I asked it I could talk to someone about how long everything took but she did not seem interested.  No apology.   Nothing.  She simply said that sometimes they aren\'t told when someone is seated outside.  Maybe that would explain the initial wait but why the terrible service after she clearly knew we were there?\n\nThis Eat\'n Park is a joke.  Extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it.  The food was ok, but paying for that meal made me feel like I was being robbed.  A group of people at the table next to us walked out after waiting 10-15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge them.

'This has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront. From the second I walked in the door no one acknowledged my sister or myself for at least five to ten minutes, which I thought was weird because they were not busy.

We finally get sat at a booth that the hostess sloppily wiped off, left crumbs all over the seat and left old trash sitting on the table. We sat in the booth for ten minutes waiting for someone to come wait on us before I finally decided enough was enough and left. My sister loves Eat n Park but every time I enter the waterfront store I\'m severely disappointed. \n \nI\'ve been a manager and a cook at two very busy restaurants in Oakland for over six years so I know what I\'m talking about.

'We had 20 people so we had our own room. The server Janee started off strong setting a tone for our meal that she would be organized and on point.  Unfortunately, that was the high point of this service.  We sat there for 20 minutes without drinks, in fact some meals started coming out and we still didn\'t have our beverages.  Half the table had Pepsi or Diet Pepsi, the other half had water and two people had dr. pepper.  I\'m not sure why they couldn\'t just get pitchers.....I got the salad bar only, it was ok but it was messy so when you went to add items other items were mixed in which is kind of gross, I thought the chili was overly salty.  The other people we were with didn\'t have much good to say about their meals, with the exception of the angus burger.  Janee did stop and take a picture of our whole table which was nice and we were there three hours so she did earn her pay, but she set the expectation high that she knew what she was doing and it fell flat pretty fast.  I\'m not sure it was all her fault as she didn\'t seem to have a staff that was working to support her, just catch her up as needed.  I think if you have 20 people at a table 2-3 staff members would make you more successful.  When we went to leave I bought a dozen of the sugar cookies.  The person at the counter didn\'t know how to ring them up and was quite rude when I asked for her to ring them up, like I was doing her a disservice by asking to purchase the restaurant\'s products.

'My experience was subpar at best the hostess didnt even offer to take our coats.  Our table was terrible we sat in an hard cusioned like material which hurt my bottom and when the \"waitress\" offered us water it did not taste like it was bottled in spain like we asked for in the beginning. Our evening then became even more nightmarish than one could ever hope for. We asked for the fresh tilapia stuffed with creme freshe and the waiter looked at us like we were foreigners something. So we had to settle for chicken fingers. And when i went to the restroom to pass those horrendous monstrosities of mutated chicken there wasnt even one of those bathroom people there to offer me a towel and their colourful company. i had to end up toweling myself with a blow dryer. I still tipped the blow dryer by inserting silver dollars into those slots. Overall you will never see me there again and i will take my business to Applebee\'s.', negative, 1, 0
'This is a stop I hit whenever I head to the Waterfront. It\'s a pretty large store with lots of goodies. Yes, it takes time to find things I like, but that\'s what discount stores are about! Overall, of all the TJ Maxxes I\'ve been to (from New Mexico to Boston), this is a pretty good one.', positive, 0, 0
'This TJ Maxx is quickly becoming a weekly stop for me! The corporate team is definitely giving this store a lot of love with the product that they receive. Lately, I haven\'t been able to go into this store without spending at least $50-100. Dangerous!\n\nAs you walk in, handbags are the first thing you see. Last time I visited the store, I was on a mission -- coffee table decor -- but was quickly sidetracked by a large, briefcase-sized, black leather Michael Kors bag priced half-off the suggested retail price. So tempting... but I forgot about this amazing bag when I stumbled upon two quality sweaters thirty seconds later. One was Design History, which is a brand currently sold at Nordstrom, Saks, Neimans, and Bluefly, for only $25. I also found Adrienne Vittadini flats for $29, Meri Meri cupcake kits for $7, Woodwick candles for $10-12, and a luxurious Tahari throw blanket for $29. I walked out of the store minus $120 in my debit account with at least $300+ of product.\n\nI\'ve also been delightfully surprised by the cleanliness of the store and the fitting rooms and by the friendliness of the staff. I was having an issue with my debit card while there, and the two associates that I worked with were very helpful and understanding about the issue.\n\nI\'ll definitely be going back in the next week or two to see what amazing new deals they\'ll have then!', positive, 0, 0

'I enjoy this TJ Maxx location. I\'m not sure that any TJ Maxx in Western PA has as good of a selection as the Johnstown TJ Maxx, (yes, that\'s right, I really did say Johnstown) but this one is pretty close. There is plenty of space, and there is a decent homegoods section as well. Not huge, but decent.\n\nThis location always has a few Bliss products, which makes it top notch in my opinion. I mean, where else can you get discounted Bliss products??\n\nI generally don\'t have a lot of success with shoes at TJ Maxx because they never seem that discounted to me, but I have struck gold at this location several times. Last summer I scored two pairs of Cole Haan wedges for under $40 at the beginning of summer, and I\'ve had success with booties here as well. Great deals on shoes makes me a happy girl!\n\nAll in all, this is a great location, and one that I frequent at least a few times per month.', positive, 0, 0
'Decent size, decent selection, decent staff.\n\nI guess that can wholly sum this place up, it\'s decent.  As with many other stores that are like this, the product rotates depending on what doesn\'t sale well at other stores.  Can always snag a deal here.  I was able to pick up a pretty sweet Puma jacket for $10, can\'t beat that, right?\n\nThat being said, there are those times that you may not find anything as well.  So really don\'t get your hopes up if you are looking for a specific item.', positive, 0, 1
'To me TJ Maxx means great items at a great price!  They always have name brand handbags, jewelry, shoes, and clothing at a great price. You find shoes from Coach, clothes from Calvin Klein, and Jewelry from Betsy Johnson. They have purses from Michael Kors, , Coach, and Kate Spade plus many others. It\'s a great place to shop for items for your home, be it bedding or cookware that you need. Plus they have great decorative items as well. It\'s a great place to not only shop for yourself but for gifts. They have the best selection of frames around. It\'s all at great prices.', positive, 0, 0
'This is the closest TJ Maxx to me. I\'m glad that the Waterfront also has discount stores because we all know i love them. I head to this store often bc its good to see if you can snag a deal. The clothes selection here is nice as well as the shoes. Recently I picked up a Nathans water bottle. I price compared on Amazon & to check reviews. It was $15 on amazon (& had GREAT reviews). It was at TJ Maxx for $7.99. WHOOO! I use it everyday and its perfect for the gym.', positive, 4, 5
'Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more. All that to say, I consider shopping here a waste of time since I could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what I want and need. Sorry, Marshalls, but you\'re just OK to me.', negative, 0, 0
'Marshalls is hit or miss with me, but during the last two visits, I found what I was looking for, for great prices. Score!  They have a decent selection of shoes, although my size is hard to come by here.  Cute handbags and I approve of their activewear selection.  One can never have too many workout clothes.  I also purchase trouser socks here.\n\nEvery now and again, I check out the housewares and I\'ve liked what I saw.  They have some unique decor and gifts, sometimes small furniture pieces.  Years ago, I purchased decorative pillows from here that match my living room furniture perfectly. I\'ve also purchased children\'s gifts (books and toys) from here.\n\nThe staff is generally pleasant and I met a friendly associate manning the dressing rooms tonight.  If you\'re into stylish reusable bags, they have some new spring designs that are cute. Just 99 cents.', positive, 1, 2
'Finally, I restaurant in Pittsburgh that I can give 4 stars!! Mitchell\'s is located on the Waterfront and is one of the nicer restaurants in that area. The interior is a classic, clean, modern seafood restaurant-- dark wood, glass, etc... The menu has really great seafood selections and is printed daily.  But here\'s what\'s great about this place: after 4pm you can get \"small plates\" at the bar for $3 each, and these ain\'t no Costco fish sticks! Two of these small plates would make a sufficient meal (along with the sourdough French bread they bring out). Finally, while the drinks aren\'t cheap, they\'re creative, tasty and fresh. All in all, I had a great experience, and I think this place would be perfect for a date or a happy hour with the girls from the typing pool.', positive, 3, 2
'No pictures!  I knew I should have taken my camera!\n\nMy aunt and I went there today for Mother\'s day.  I think we must have gotten the lunch menu because everything looked pretty cheap (I\'ve been to the one in Columbus).  My aunt had a chicken dinner (grilled chicken, green beans and potatoes with butter) and I had their Shanghai sampler which had a couple of shrimp, a couple of scallops and a nice piece of salmon, all done perfectly.  We didn\'t order dessert since my aunt had made my favorite pumpkin pie!  Anyway, dinner was great, and so was the service, thus the five stars!', positive, 5, 2
'This is one of the few restaurants I frequent in the Waterfront. Why would you come to Mitchell\'s if not for the fish/seafood? You probably wouldn\'t. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that\'s a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won\'t get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  \nThe food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island\'s south shore (but that\'s another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell\'s at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.', positive, 1, 0
'Mtchells is one of the best fish places around.  I really like their Shanghi preparation of my fish. It\'s just delicious.\n\nThe establishment is always clean, the staff courteous and the fish, of course, fresh.  \n\nOddly enough one of my favorite things about going here besides the fish is the bread they give you.  It\'s always so warm and tasty.\n\nThe deserts are also very tasty.  I have gotten two that I really liked\n\nThey also have a three course fixed price option last I went that was a great value. I think it was $20/person for lunch.', positive, 1, 0
'An excellent choice for fresh, well prepared seafood located in the Waterfront area in Homestead.   I frequent this area for business travel, and you can\'t do much better without heading downtown.\n\nThe seafood is excellent, with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials, a raw bar, and a list of chef\'s specialties.  The house salad is sweet and delicious, and the \'shanghai\' seafood preparation is delicious, healthy, and unique.  Try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.\n\nThere is a nice selection of regional beers on tap, a decent selections of wines, and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).  The deserts are adequate, though not a highlight.  \n\nIf you\'re on the Waterfront, you won\'t do better than this.  Enjoy!', positive, 1, 0
'I was impressed.  \n\nWent here for lunch.  The seafood gumbo was tremendous.  I wasn\'t in the mood for more seafood so I had the chicken blt on ciabatta bread.  I\'m not sure what type of creamy sauce they put on the bread, but it was delicious.  Will go back again.\n\nThe food was reasonably priced for lunch.  Dinner would obviously be more expensive but I imagine it\'s worth the $.', positive, 0, 0

My mom\'s chilean sea bass shanghi style came with sticky rice and spinach. The sea bass had nice texture and was reasonably priced. My lobster and shrimp pappardelle had more shrimp than I expected.

'I took my cousin from California here for lunch. We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother\'s house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother\'s, you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell\'s, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn\'t overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn\'t much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn\'t too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn\'t a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it\'s the best carrot cake I\'ve ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than \"cheesy\", it was a great surprise when you\'re expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I\'ve tasted in the past. I highly recommend it. It was a wonderful lunch and I\'m sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to Riverside.', positive, 2, 0
'This place has great seafood. The best in the area. I come here for seafood every time. Everything on their menu is good. Their menu changes all the time depending on what was in season. Appetizers are amazing like the raw oysters.  Their clam chowder is the best. Really creamy with lots of clams. Wonderful restaurant. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. We love coming to this restaurant. Don\'t forget a reservation on weekends. You will not get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you don\'t have one. We never get to the dessert. Always too full to eat dessert.   Forgot to take pictures.', positive, 1, 1

'Delightful! After biking on the river trail that led us to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at Mitchell\'s, right on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn\'t help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don\'t eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don\'t go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren\'t bad (it was the lunch menu - I\'m sure the dinner menu is pricier.) I felt like I was on vacation and I\'ll definitely be back!', positive, 0, 0

'DRINKS: Water for me, Yuengling for my fiance\nAPPETIZERS: Cup of Maine Lobster Bisque for me -- soo good! My fiance had the New Orleans Seafood Gumbo which I had a taste of it and it was good, but I liked my soup better...very rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in. The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but I felt I couldn\'t enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can\'t handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often).\nENTREES: I had one of the specials, Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy, I\'ll def order that next time! We both finished our plates, which wasn\'t too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.\nDESSERT: Didn\'t order any\nSERVICE: Friendly, though a little sparse. After we finished our meals we felt like we were waiting around for awhile before we could ask for our check. But our server was overall friendly and we didn\'t feel neglected or anything.\nDEALS/DISCOUNTS: None\nOVERALL: We liked the variety and freshness of seafood.

The steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcake was a good size. Atmosphere was good and busy but that is likely because of it being Valentines day.

Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt \"bad where I hope they improve.\"  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  \n\nSeared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn\'t cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback\'s ahi tuna appetizer and it\'s no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He\'s a nice guy like me I hope.)  \n\nBBQ shrimp: go try Redstone\'s (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients\' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real \"must-miss\".  \n\nCod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?

'Mitchell\'s is located on the river side of the Waterfront and out of the crazy \"let\'s fight to find a parking spot\" area.  They do take reservations, but doubtful you need one on a weekday during lunch.  It wasn\'t busy when I was there on a Tuesday at noon.\n\nMitchell\'s has a cool layout - large full bar in the middle, private large rooms for large parties, smaller areas for business lunches, full dining room seating with tables and booths, and an excellent outdoor patio where you can watch people ride by on the bike trail.  \n\nThis is a seafood restaurant with lots of good options for fresh in season fish.  You can choose from a number of different fish to have prepared for salads, sandwiches, or just as they are.  I had the chopped salad and added scallops to it.  Delicious!  \n\nThe price range is reasonable and you can plan on spending around $15 with your lunch and a soda/iced tea.  For that price, you really can\'t complain.  I drop almost that much at Panera on a half sandwich and cup of soup with an iced tea.  \n\nI\'m sure it\'s much busier for dinner but I find Mitchell\'s to be an excellent place for a business lunch or just meeting friends.  I\'ve been here for brunch as well and had an excellent Bloody Mary and eggs benedict with crab.', positive, 1, 0
'Went for dinner Friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. It is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. The sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. The Cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. I had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. It was so delicious. My friend had the creme  brûlée, which she said was very good. I was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent.', positive, 0, 0
'My family and I go here whenever there is a special occasion and for good reason. The food is fantastic and the service cannot be beat, at least not when it\'s coming from the Governor or Kennedy. Best servers in the \'burgh!! I took my Dad there last weekend for his 70th birthday, didn\'t tell anyone that it was a special night out, but they treated us with such attention, accommodating our needs to a T. Kennedy adjusted meals to fit our taste, suggested things based on what we were looking for, took at least 10 minutes with us going over the menu...I could go on, but needless to say, it was just a fabulous meal and was worth every penny. We got the king crab and bacon wrapped shrimp to start, lobster bisque soup, cedar plank salmon, Chilean sea bass, and a fish medley made to order. We also always get the 7 layer carrot cake, which to me is the best cake anywhere in town.  A must go for anyone looking for an amazing meal and excellent service. But be sure and ask for Kennedy, he\'s a real dude.', positive, 0, 0
'Have been here a few times. The wait staff is always top notch and food is very good. I had the steak and lobster tail. Steak was a perfect medium rare and the lobster was also cooked well.

'A OK!\n\nReally loved the bacon wrapped shrimp! So amazing with the sauce on the side. This was probably the the best part of the meal.  \n\nI also had blacken salmon with a double order of spinach instead of a starch. The spinach was just steamed without any flavoring... Which is better in the long run,  but I wish they had options for sauteed with garlic. \n\nThe service was great as well!  We were always taken care of.  \n\nWill definitely bring my bf here in the future.', positive, 2, 0
'This was my first time at this location.  I\'ve frequented the Upper St Clair Galleria restaurant.  There\'s a lot to like about this Columbus OH based chain.  I don\'t usually eat at chain restaurants nor will I review them because they\'re typically big food corporate run places that don\'t care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders.  This place seems different to me.  The food quality and care seems to be very high.  \n\nThe staff is always well trained.  I like the decor and ambiance.  The menu offers many options.  I don\'t really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan.  I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here.  I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home.  \n\nWe were here for a Thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people.  The room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall.  It\'s a tough thing to do.  It wasn\'t perfect for sure but the food was surprisingly good and came out hot and fresh.  Nicely done.', positive, 3, 1
'My husbands first time.  Nice to be able to pick your fish and style of cooking.  I had a trio of Jamaican jerk tilapia,  salmon,  and scallops.  All good but too much sauce on scallops.  Husband had surf n turf special. Snow crab legs tasty but smaller portion than I expected. Glad they had raw oysters,  but no idea where they were from.  For $2.50 each you\'d think they\'d say.  Waitstaff friendly but inexperienced when it came to wine.  We taught two of them how to open a champagne bottle.  Nice time out,  but two gripes... #1 Used my phones flashlight to see if there was an outlet on the floor.  Felt like an archaeologist finding old remains of dinners gone by.  Crumbs,  napkins wedged between booth and wall,  gum,  dirt.  For the price I would expect a cleaner place. #2 our waiter kept saying Thank you. After every single sentence,  even when it wasn\'t appropriate.  Silly gripe,  right?  But it was way over the top and felt more like,  Can I have a tip?  Can I have a tip?', positive, 0, 0
'In the Homestead area of Pittsburgh. Seafood gumbo was very good.\nBroiled scallops were very good, partner had sea bass stuffed with lobster, also very good.

'Unlike some other reviewers here that came to a FISH MARKET looking for vegan food (and didn\'t like it, who would have guessed !! :| ), I came here to eat fish.. and it was delicious.. \n\nI had atlantic salmon on special, with chili citrus glaze, that turned out awesome.. we also ordered cedar plank trout which didn\'t disappoint either.. overall, a real good first seafood experience for this place.. I\'d have loved to give them 5 stars, but I\'d hold that till they add some nice local beers..', positive, 1, 0
'Whoever gave this place 4 or five stars must be out of their minds. Had dinner here in July and it was so so. I was looking for a fish place in town again, and figured, after reading positive reviews that it had improved. Yikes. Bad decision. \n\nThe staff seemed put out that anyone was here at all, and were seemingly puzzled by the menu. I watched two bartenders trying to figure out how to make a strawberry daiquiri for 5 minutes, which was admittedly entertaining. \n\nI ordered the chowder and the crab cakes. The chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes. I\'m guessing that there may have been a clam or two in there somewhere, but you couldn\'t taste it if there was through the flour. \n\nThe crab cakes were definitely frozen, and not made from blue crab. If you\'re going to offer Chesapeake crab cakes, they had damn well better be the real deal. Zero flavor and dry as hell. Stringy, Asian crab that was definitely pre-made. Terrible. \n\nI don\'t like to rip a spot, but this was a seriously weak restaurant. Don\'t know why I expected western PA to offer up the goods, but if Chicago can do it well, why not Pittsburgh.

'Very disappointing Easter dinner.  We had eaten here twice last year and the service was impeccable, food delicious, piping hot.  I did not realize that Ruth\'s Chris had sold to Landry\'s, the change is not a good one.  We made reservations for five and were seated promptly, drinks were brought.  A very good crab dip and salads were enjoyed by all.  Then the main courses arrived.  First let me say that something occurred because the table seated after us of the same size were served first. Finally four of our five meals were brought.  The hush puppies and fries were cold, the seafood was ok, the coleslaw was warm as if it had all sat under a warming light.  The planked salmon was good but not hot.  Five minutes later the $32 Easter special came out. One tiny lobster tail with some salty stuffing. No discernible seafood in the stuffing.  4 small very dry over cooked shrimp with a blob of salty stuffing, a large blob of cold dry hard mashed redskins.  We were all shocked.  Our waitress, who was actually wonderful felt terrible and knew something had gone wrong when she saw the other table served before us and then us short a plate.  She spoke to her manager several times and asked him to talk to us.  When he finally did he told me he was sorry and that I should have told him sooner so he could fix it???  He was very rude to us.  Offered us a free dessert. I told him he couldn\'t possibly think I was going to pay for inedible food. He begrudgingly took  the price of 2 of the less expensive entrees off the bill.  I had been looking forward to this holiday meal for weeks.  His poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday.  I will never go back.  Stephen Gray, manager of Mitchells in Homestead, you should be ashamed of how you treated us.  Landry\'s needs to look into this restaurant if they expect people to keep coming.  Those prices are only acceptable for fantastic food and service.', negative, 0, 0
'There really are not too many seafood options here in Pittsburgh. I have been here 3 times so far, and each time has been very good. This last Friday I walked in, and I was able to be seated immediately without a reservation. It was about 6:30 when we went in, and at about 8pm when we left, it was pretty packed. The seafood has always been good and fresh, and this was the first time in my life that I had swordfish and it was moist and tasty. They have a signature way of steaming their fish (if you ask for it this way) with ginger, sesame seeds and soy sauce over spinach and rice. It is excellent. They have a full bar, with a few good drafts (Guiness and Dogfish 60). Definitely pricey among the Waterfront restaurants, but to me it is worth it.', positive, 0, 0
'It depends on what you order here as this can be a reasonable meal or a splurge. They have some delicious tilapia/trout/salmon entrees with veggie and starch in that sweet spot of $20; however, if you want you could easily go $35+ a plate. The spinach salad with chevre and roasted pecans was awesome. \n\nWine was surprisingly reasonable and they were food allergy friendly.\n\nBetter than Red Lobster and not nearly as busy as PF Changs or Bravo!--so you might be able to walk in.\n\nWould give a 3.5 if I could.', positive, 1, 0
'The food was delicious. Excellent seafood, and plenty of things to choose from on the menu. However, the service we experienced was terrible. We sat at our table for 10-15 minutes before anyone even noticed we were there. Keep in mind, we were here late afternoon/early evening so the place was half empty. Once we ordered my draft beer took 10 minutes to come out, then it was wrong. I kept it anyways or else I\'d probably still be sitting there waiting for it. Good food, but I won\'t be in a hurry to go back.', negative, 0, 0
'First time in Pittsburgh on biz and staying in the Waterfront District. Nice selection of better than average chain restaurants on the area. Spotted Mitchell\'s Seafood and since I never heard of ot before, decided to make it my evening dinner choice - in fact, looked forward all day to a nice shellfish dinner ala Bonefish Grill. They have a nice al fresco patio overlooking the River that I wish I say at.  Place was pretty empty at 8 pm on a Monday night, but that\'s to be expected. I ordered the Seafood Americana which was supposed to have sautéed shrimp and scallops in a light butter sauce. What I got in return was a plate of small shrimp in a brown gravy with NO scallops whatsoever. I immediately returned the dish and the young and nice manager came over to make it right, so I reordered a different steamed shrimp and scallops dish which was much better- 5 larger shrimp and 5 sea scallops over spinach and veggies with a soy sauce on the side - very nice but wish they had drained the ingredients better so they didn\'t end up on a soupy broth.  Having waited tables in a high end seafood restaurant through graduate school I am tempted to attributing this experience to Monday night, late dinner, inexperienced cooks, and lack of kitchen or server oversight. I hope your experience is better than mine. Too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry.  Disappointed.', negative, 1, 0
'I am posting my review again as it was not deemed important enough to keep.  Funny within days I was contacted by customer service of Landry\'s asking for my contact information.

'I took my daughter here for lunch. She had been wanting to come for a good while. She\'s graduating high school next week so it seemed like the perfect time. She had the clam chowder and the shrimp scampi. It was great. She wished that the chowder was slightly thinner but enjoyed the alfredo-like flavor. I was not in the mood for seafood so I had the bacon cheeseburger. You can\'t go wrong with a burger right? Well, let me tell you, that was one of the best burgers that I\'ve had and I frequent restaurants who specialize in them. It had a beautiful char flavor to it. I did not need any condiments. The broccoli I had was wonderful as well and I especially enjoyed the seasoning.\n\nThe only thing that slightly sullied it for me is that it was too dark.

'very disappointing.  i have been a patron of this restaurant/location since it opened.....usually dining there about once a month.  my last few visits were fine, not great, but fine.  today was not.  the restaurant was about half full, i was with one other person.\n     food---  my friend had a ceasar salad:  the staff didn\'t know where the anchovies were, therefore none.  it was served at room temperature.  chef\'s special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp.  it also was served at room temperature.  i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables.  the scallops, too, were at room temperature and only seared on one side, some not at all.  the manager offered to redo the meals, which we accepted.  she shrugged her shoulders and said she didn\'t know what else she could do.  the scallops were better the 2nd time, penne was watery, crab was all but invisible.  the garnish had cheese on it the first time, not the 2nd.  penne was mediocre at best.\n     service--- probably the worst service i\'ve ever had there.  our server seemed overwhelmed, apologized continually to us and every other table she had nearby.  maybe that was part of the reason our meals were not hot the first time.  never did get a refill on iced tea.\n     ambiance--- the place is starting to look tired.  the tables are showing their age.... the surface hasn\'t been kept up, the finish has long since worn off in the most used parts.\n\nsorry to see this place go down hill.  have many memories of better times.  may not ever go back.  looking for a new place in the area.', negative, 0, 0
'Will not eat here again.\n\n1) Waitress (Angela) could not be found for 10+ minutes at a time. The entire meal was a running commentary on where she was and why we didn\'t even get water refills until dinner came. She had to be specifically asked three times for water before we got our one and only refill.\n\n2) Spilled mussel butter on my jacket and although she did apologize no manager ever came over to see if we were okay. When I did complain they offered a $25 gift card which didn\'t even cover the cost of said jacket, thanks but no thanks.\n\n3) When asked specifically if a dessert was served warm the waitress said \"yes, of course\" but spoiler alert it wasn\'t. Party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something.\n\n4) When asked if they had a very specific after dessert drink the waitress replied in the affirmative only to substitute Irish coffee instead. If you are out of something just own up to it, don\'t try to pull one over on someone.\n\nLong story short - decent if overpriced food, nonexistent management and the worst service I have experienced in a long while.

'After a long but beautiful day touring Pittsburgh and riding the Duquesne Incline we settled down for a late dinner at Mitchell\'s fish market.\nWe were seated in a picture perfect spot by the window as requested. Our waiter initially greeted us warmly but the service went south quickly and I trying to wrap my head around - Why?  \nWhat was wrong with the service you wondered. Well.....\n*We had to wait a long time for our drinks \n*appetizers ordered but not received.\n* Requested bread several times waiter was oblivious to the request \n* Dinner took for ever it felt like a century later\n It was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste. \nWe observed the other waiters and waitress was busy attending to their patrons. \nOn the plus side the food was divinely delicious!  Salmon, scallops- Super fresh and melted in my mouth.  My husband\'s dish ordered the Shrimp and Crab Cakes and he hummed  yum to every bite he ate.  Unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand.  If only the head manager who was consistently walking around to various tables talking to patrons would have stop at our table we could have given him the scoop about our lack of service.

'What has happened to this place? It use to be the best around; now within the last few months it has gone completely down hill. The quality is completely gone, portions are smaller, prices higher. From what I read it\'s a company change, but how could this make a place go from wonderful to horrible so quickly? The server even tried pushing a diners club program on us!!! Who would pay for a dining program to this place!?!? That\'s right, I said pay! The company wants you to pay for a membership! Why should a loyal customer pay to be rewarded for being LOYAL??? Why would anyone even pay for such lousy food? The place is not even kept up anymore. The atmosphere has become dingy and even the dish my $30 + meal came out on felt grimy!!! My silver was even wrapped in torn linens! Where is the management? How can they allow such expensive meals to go out on dirty dishes? Where has my wonderful night out gone? I use to look forward all week to when having a night out here. Now I don\'t even want to drive past! Even the staff is miserable anymore. Everyone use to be so pleasant and welcoming, and now they seem run down and well, miserable. I\'ve come back now 3 times hoping my experiences were flukes, unfortunately this place is just not what it use to be! I\'m sad knowing my favorite restaurant is now gone!Do yourself a favor and don\'t waste your hard earned money here.

'Last night was my first visit to Mitchell\'s and I was really looking forward to some great seafood.  I am sorry to say I did not get it.  I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed.  There were five very small shrimp on the plate.  The shrimp were dry and overcooked.  The crab stuffing was mostly stuffing.  All I tasted was breading.  I didn\'t see a piece of lump crab anywhere.  The best part of the meal was the bread and butter.  I was with a party of 12 people and I was surprised to see such small portions on the others plates.

'After doing some chores at The Waterfront, we were hungry and decided to try Mitchell\'s for dinner. We were seated at a comfortable red booth. The clam chowder was perfect; definitely get it. The mussels were delicious--not as firm as mussels usually are (but in a good way) and bigger than normal. The spicy crispy shrimp surprised me; I didn\'t think it would be good, but it was. Boyfriend said his lobster bisque was \"funky\" and I agreed that it tasted weird, but it was still edible. \n\nThe calamari, however, was unseasoned. Maybe they forgot to season it that night? I feel like the way it was served to us is not the way they usually serve it. Also, I was disappointed with the small portion of the calamari. For $12, we should be getting way more than we did. \n\nOur server was attentive and noticed that we liked a lot of their appetizers, so she informed us about their happy hour (Monday through Friday 4:30-6:30pm) where their appetizers are at most $7 each!

'This is a really hard review for me to write, simply because I cannot for the life of me find the words to explain the food. Lackluster, no, not really...Mediocre...no....Pedestrian/average/common...huh uh. Just \'eh.\' It wasn\'t awful, terrible or even bad, and it wasn\'t great, good or even fine. It was just....edible, I guess.  \nWe started with shrimp dumplings from the happy hour menu and the BF got seafood gumbo. I thought the gumbo was decent; he said \'eh\', however we both agreed the dumplings were \'eh\'. \nI got something called the market trio, which came with creole style rice, corn, a crab cake, a hunk of salmon and 5 shrimp. It wasn\'t terrible, inedible food, it was just....not good. And for $28 I wish I would have just gotten a bowl of the gumbo. The only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice. The BF got a crab and lobster stuffed cod, which again, was not bad just not good. It had a lemony-buttery sauce, that didn\'t taste quite lemony or buttery somehow. \nI know this is a stupid thing to gripe about, but I hatehatehate when restaurants charge necessarily high prices for pop. Soda, cola, pop, call it what you want, but it should never be more than $2.50. I usually just drink water with lemon, but I had a headache, so I ordered a coke. $325!! And having a BF who works for a restaurant, I know that pop costs them pennies! I see $2-2.50; some people drink glass after glass of the stuff, but $3.25 is simply ridiculous. Especially when the food kinda sucks. And I read other reviews and the decor is not classy. It\'s like it\'s trying to be classy, but real classy restaurants know its\' not classy. It was a little like an over-priced, under-flavored Red Lobster without the kickass cheese biscuits.

The scallops were perfectly cooked and the flavor of the broth was fantastic. My shrimp were over cooked though, thus the four star review.

'Since Mitchell\'s went corporate, it has gone downhill from the quality and service customers used to receive. This place has been hit or miss the last few times. This time it started off as a miss but finished with a homerun.\n\nWe had dinner reservations for 3 at 6:45PM. Upon entering the restaurant was extremely busy, with a good bit of people in the waiting area. We arrived at 6:25 and immediately checked in. 6:30 came, same amount of people still in waiting area. 6:45, the 6:30 reservations were still waiting to be seated.

At 7:05 we were finally sat.\n\nOur server was excellent. Came by often to refill waters and take new drink orders. Helped us with our menu questions and gave suggestions. Our appetizer came out quickly with enough of a gap between our entrees which is always a plus! I got the Shanghai Chilean SeaBass. Cooked perfectly!! \n\nThe initial experience was setting the stage for an irritating evening but once we were sat the service from our waitress and quality of food quickly made up for the early mishap.', positive, 0, 0

'I gave two stars only because we didn\'t actually eat any of the food. This is simply a customer service review. I\'d like to give them the benefit of the doubt, the food is probably excellent. Sadly, the hostess was so incredibly rude and uninviting, the mood was ruined before we even met the server. \n\nUpon our arrival (party of 2), I asked to see a menu. 20 minutes later we had still not been acknowledged. 4 other groups came came and we\'re seated as we stood there, looking toward the hostesses expectantly. After quite some time the hostess stared at me, I suppose waiting for me to greet myself. No \'Hello\' no \'may I help you?\' Finally a curt \'have you been helped?\' to which we responded \'no\'. The hostess brusquely grabbed two menus, didn\'t ask whether we were expecting more people, didn\'t ask whether we wanted a booth or a table (every other patron was offered their preference) and stated FOLLOW ME. She literally threw our menus down on a booth passing by, didn\'t stop to await us take our seats, didn\'t introduce or even mention our server or anything. Simply threw our menus down on the table and left, not a word spoken. We didn\'t remain there long enough to meet our server, which is unfortunate because I was really hoping to have a nice meal there. I will not return.', negative, 0, 0
'We went to Mitchell\'s last weekend to celebrate my BFF\'s birthday.  She has been to Mitchells several times and speaks highly about it.  I have been there before but is has been several years and really didn\'t recall much.  But like my friend I love seafood so there was no objections there.\n\nThe menu isn\'t too big, which is good, and they allow you to choose sides vs giving you what they deem you should have with your meal.  Our waitress was very nice. We arrived a little after my friend, but waited about 15 minutes for her other friend and date to show.  Once settled in we all placed our orders.\n\nI decided on a yellowfin tuna, prepared medium rare, and for the sides I requested a double order of asparagus.  We didn\'t wait too long for our 6 meals to arrive.  However, 3 out of 6 of those contained mistakes.  My BFF asked for coleslaw.  Not there.  Easy fix they brought it out.  My husband wanted fries, he got potatoes.  Ok so now he gets both for same price, so I guess another easy fix.  And then there was me.  They just straight up brought me someone else\'s food.  The waitress quickly grabbed it up after I said to the guy this isn\'t what I ordered.  There was rice on the plate, and I don\'t know what fish since it only sat in front of me for a few seconds before being snatched away.  I only waited a few minutes and she brought me my correct meal.\n\nThe yellowfin looked amazing.  Nice thick portion, and once I cut into it, it was beautifully cooked and seasoned well.  However, my \"double\" order of asparagus was FIVE spears.  Before the waitress left after bringing the correct order I said something to her about it.  That to which she said, \"That is a double\".  Hmmm.  So a single order is 2 and  1/2 pieces of asparagus right?  That\'s bunk.  My fellow diners felt sorry for me and offered up some of their veggies, very sweet of them.  Weird thing was, my friend\'s other friends date ordered asparagus as one of his sides and got 4 pieces.  So was it just me or maybe they need some help executing in the kitchen and in service.  Not to mention the meal was $32.00, and I just bought a bundle of asparagus for 1.88 at the Giant Eagle!  \n\nSo other than the mix-ups and the asparagus situation of 2016, I really enjoyed my meal and time at Mitchells.  The fish was as noted very tasty, but the price is reflective of a special occasion dinner option.', positive, 20, 18

'Mitchell\'s was surprisingly good.  Everything I tasted was good or better, and there were plenty of options.  Everything I drank was good or better, and there are options for everyone.  The atmosphere was great (especially sitting outside on one of the rare nice days), which definitely enhanced the experience (though don\'t count on that part being reliable in Pittsburgh...).  My dings against the place are mostly minor (e.g., tiny hiccups in service), but for one: it\'s a bit pricey for the category in which I\'d place it, though it\'s still a great option in that category.', positive, 0, 0
'We were really looking forward to the acclaimed restaurant scene in our hometown of Pittsburgh, after having retired to Arizona 6 years ago.  We had remembered Mitchell\'s Fish Market as excellent for seafood, as well as (surprisingly) steak. Wow, were we disappointed!!!!!  The near-empty parking lot at 8:00 PM on a Friday was the first clue. The misunderstandings about the reservation and being treated accusingly by the front greeters who were arguing with each other was the second clue.  The lack of availability of the first 3 choices we made from the menu was the third clue.  The shoe really dropped when the food came.  Both my blackened cod, the steamed vegetables with it and the side of asparagus in hollandaise were ALL cold, dry and hard.  The cod portion was tiny.  MY partner\'s fillet of beef ordered \"medium rare to medium well with some pink\" was black on the outside, dry, cold and very well done.  Others in our party of six had similar experiences with just plain tough batter-dipped and greasy fried fish for one and cold, dry, small portion of \"fresh\" fish for another.  We were told that this place had changed management in the past 5 years.  In light of its poor quality of food at upscale prices, Mitchell\'s Fish Market deserves to fail and close.', negative, 1, 0

Ordered the tuna medium and came out rare.  They redid it but this time was way overcooked.  Ate it anyway.  Are the chefs so inexperienced that they can\'t tell when something is rare, medium, or well done?  \n\nAnyway, haven\'t been there in years until now and I remember why I avoided this place.', negative, 0, 0

Yes, it\'s Old Navy, but I shopped in this store three times over the past week and did not have anyone come up to me while wandering around the outerwear.

'I don\'t see to many options in Pittsburgh for sporting goods. Dick\'s seems to be the big chain for sporting paraphernalia in this neck of the woods. Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it\'s good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products.', negative, 1, 0
'I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the worst Dick\'s location that I\'ve ever been to. The selection is very limited for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It\'s mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.\n\nThe staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it\'s the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don\'t have what we\'re looking for). \n\nThey do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you\'re looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn\'t have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a \"good\" Dick\'s location.', negative, 3, 1

I also found a small child in the back of the store playing dangerously on one of the elliptical machines, which is something that both his parents and the store\'s staff should have addressed.

In Dick\'s defense, I\'m super cheap. \n\nI found a table full of running shoes (note: I don\'t run) and one pair in particular that were very  cute but were still pricey. So I was pretty bummed because I would have bought them if they were, say, thirty bucks cheaper. Not to run, of course, but still nice for riding the elliptical, walking at the park, going to yoga class, or - hey - running....errands.\n\nAnyhow, I headed back to find the H in the fishing / hunting area.

'You know it\'s bad when a McDonald\'s gets a 1 star review...I mean, seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a McDonald\'s. The whole point of going to McDonald\'s is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn\'t cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn\'t even eaten at a McDonald\'s in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!\n\nForget the fact that McDonald\'s food isn\'t great. We all know it\'s not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won\'t be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn\'t say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn\'t print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\n\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely.

'I have to admit, the first time I hate here, I absolutely hated the pizza. And I think it was because I was expecting something completely different than I got. Latina Pizza is very different from most pizza shops. Instead if a round thin crust pizza, this pizza is square, thick, and doughy. The crust is not really that good, but that is not why you get a pizza here. It\'s the homemade sauce. And that it is a family owned place that is  really pretty inexpensive. \n\nThe other nice thing about this shop is that it is right next to Kennywood. So usually around dinnertime we leave the park and walk over here to order some pizzas and drinks. No lines, no waiting for tables, no outrageous prices. It\'s a time to recharge, and sometimes we feel like going back to the park,  other times we decide to go home.', positive, 4, 0

'This is the best bike store I\'ve walked into.  Their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as I\'m not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.\n\nGot greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I\'m 6\'8\", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)\n\nAnyways, back to my girlfriend\'s experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn\'t ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.\n\nThe amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it\'s worth it to browse here.\n\nAnd, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25\% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it\'d cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  \n\nThat said, the price he quoted me was also 10\% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  \n\nCustomer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.\n\n\nEdit, 4 years later: \n\nGlen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)\n\nIt\'s still a much longer drive to get to Big Bang, but for any work on my bike, I\'m glad to make the drive.

'This is the best experience I\'ve had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I\'m fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I\'m a student, I don\'t have particularly deep pockets.\n\nAt Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I\'m kind of shy when I know that I don\'t really know what I\'m doing, but I wasn\'t pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you\'re properly fitted to the bike.\n\nAlso, this is one of the few bike stores I\'ve been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it\'s the only bike store where they\'ll tell you \"You haven\'t tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!\" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who\'s looking for a road bike, whether they\'re a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.', positive, 0, 0
'When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don\'t find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\"S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don\'t hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that\'s ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I\'ll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \"Should be ready in a few days\". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don\'t think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can\'t see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \"duke it over\" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn\'t.  Well BBB I\'ll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I\'ll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?', negative, 1, 0
'I wrote this review right after I had bought my bike.  I would like to update to reflect further experiences I\'ve had with BBB.\n\nSo, first of all, one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective (not super-unusual for the Shimano short-reach shifters, also totally not the shop\'s fault -- these things happen).  Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.\n\nMy husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can\'t remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.\n\nI would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.

I basically just walked in and said I was interested in a road bike but knew very little about them (I\'m a MTBr). I was helped by Glenn, who, within two minutes, had me sitting on a bike, measuring me and adjusting things, and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike. At no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact, he didn\'t even ask me about a budget). He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new. He was very obviously focused on getting me the product that will give me the most efficiency and power for my needs. So very impressed...this is absolutely where I will be buying my bike.', positive, 0, 0
'If you\'re in the market for a high quality bike, whether it be road, mountain, racing, or hybrid, go to see Glenn at BBB.  It\'s very clear that he loves his shop and his job.  I explained my needs and preferences to him and he quickly fitted me with a bike that suited my needs.   I actually bought my Trek 7300 over 3 years ago and I absolutely love it!  He sells only the highest quality bikes and equipment.  Highly recommended.', positive, 0, 0
'My experience at Big Bang Bicycles was what I have been looking for in the western Pa. area. I have been looking for trusted advice concerning a new road bike and proper fitting during the purchase process.  I am 6\'4\" and I found out quickly that regardless of the time of the year, it was very difficult to find a shop which stocked bikes of quality that I could properly test ride.  Big Bang and owner Glenn couldn\'t have been more patient of all my questions and concerns.  His knowledge is remarkable and he took his time fitting me and explaining the process. He had several bikes I could demo in my size.  After deciding on a model to order Glenn, Craig, and Samson who I had the pleasure of working with, continued to help me through ordering the bike, getting it assembled upon delivery, and taking a significant amount of time going through the bike with me and how to maintain it properly. The shop has an amazing variety of helmets, clothing, and other things that a cyclists might want to purchase. Even though I live in the north hills, if I need anything from service to merchandise, I will not hesitate to go to Big Bang Bicycles.  Glenn and the others that work at the shop are well worth the trip.', positive, 0, 1

'I\'ve lived in 3 cities before coming to Pittsburgh, and I have not received service anywhere better than this place. Their prices and selection are unparalleled elsewhere in the city. The mechanics are certainly the best. and the beuty about this place is they treat everybody with utmost respect - I was treated like I was a pro day 1, even though I am novice in every sense of the word\n\nMy only gripe initially was the location, but after coming here several times, I understand why this is the Mecca of bicycles not only in Pittsburgh, but whole Western PA. \n\nKeep up the good work guys', positive, 0, 0

Glenn, Craig and the ENTIRE team effectively demonstrated technical expertise, a passion for the sport and most importantly, a deep respect for their customers. I not only witnessed it myself but witnessed it with other customers while I was waiting. \n\nWhether you\'re new to the sport or a long time cyclist seeking a new and better experience, there simply is no better shop than Big Bang.

'What, you haven\'t been to Bellisario\'s yet? This is about the only red sauce pizza I ever get a craving for, and boy howdy is it good. The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don\'t drown the pizza in it. There\'s just enough cheese; not so much it\'s an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can\'t tell it\'s there. If you can go while Mama\'s working, all the better.\n\nYou can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can\'t beat that. And I\'d put Bellisario\'s pizza up against any in the city.\n\nI grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario\'s and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I\'ve had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.\n\nIt\'s a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it\'s perfect. If you\'re in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza. They\'ve also got hoagies and calzones, and I think that\'s about it. But with pizza this good, who cares?', positive, 5, 4
'Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne, PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg, PA of all places. Where I am at, really there is no delivery but these guys did. They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg, Downtown, run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi. That pizza is/was MILES better than this. This crust, while thin, did not have flavor and was hard. The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like. The cheese was good. The sauce was meh. I\'ve definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering.', negative, 1, 2
'Pizza is very hit or miss. When the owners are there, it\'s really good. When they aren\'t, you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times. The pizza, even when plain, is very greasy. Way more than other places around. Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. Also they do not take credit or debit cards. There are better options.', negative, 0, 0
'Incredible. The Pizza is the best in the area, by far. The Sandwiches are great as well, but in my opinion the best food they have is their Calzones, which I highly recommend. This place deserves a 5-Star as far as their food is concerned, but the dine-in potion of the shop is tiny and makes dining-in quite unenjoyable, so I\'m forced to give them 4-stars. Would highly recommend either picking up or having something delivered, not so much on eating there though.', positive, 0, 0
'This FBO may not look like much on the outside considering it\'s housed in a double wide trailer next to a cemetery, but once you are inside everything changes. This FBO is staffed by very friendly counter and ramp people and it is surprisingly nice inside.

Crew cars and cheap fuel make this the airport of choice when flying into Pittsburgh.', positive, 2, 1
'One of the best FBOs when flying to Pittsburgh. Fuel is cheap, they have a crew car (A Jeep Compass) that they let you use for free on a first-come, first serve basis for a few hours. \n\nLanding fees are waived with fuel purchase. Overnight parking is $15 for a typical single engine plane. The staff is super nice; they have coffee, cherries and cookies for you inside and it\'s so close to downtown Pittsburgh!\n\nThere are two FBOs at AGC and every pilot I\'ve talked to recommends going to Voyager for fantastic service. After my very brief flight there, I agree wholeheartedly! I can\'t wait to go back and bring my wife for a Pittsburgh weekend getaway.\n\nIt looks a little beat up, because as the previous reviewer mentioned...it\'s housed in a double wide trailer, but the facilities are modern inside and they are doing some construction/expanding, so I have a feeling it will change quite a bit soon!', positive, 1, 2

'You have never had a pierogie until you\'ve driven out to McKees Rocks and picked up a dozen or so from Pierogies Plus.

'Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.\n\nI live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer\'s freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.\n\nThe place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.\n\nOh, but you\'ll be happy you did. I\'m vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I\'m in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you\'ll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I\'m serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It\'s the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.\n\nYou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.\n\nBesides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.\n\nAwesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.\n\nThe only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I\'ve learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.', positive, 1, 0
'These pierogies are one of my favorite things in the world. They\'re freakin\' amazing. The potato and jalapeno ones are my favorite.

'I was planning to attend a conference in Pittsburgh and was researching food joints that I wanted to check out. A friend of mine insisted that I go to Pierogies Plus telling me that the food was so good that ever since he went that he has had pierogies mail-ordered to his house each year. While I have never been a huge fan of pierogies, I figured that I should heed my friends advice since he generally steers me to places I enjoy. Let\'s just say in this case, he hit the ball out of the park.\n\nI actually wound up going to Pierogies Plus straight from the airport. After getting in a rental car and plugging in my GPS, imagine my surprise when my GPS announced \"You have reached your destination.\" and I found myself sitting outside what appeared to be an old service station. When I walked inside and up to the counter, I found a crew of Polish women rocking out every kind of Pierogi imaginable. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choices.\n\nWanting to try everything, I wound up going with their Sampler Platter #1 which was a small haluski (a noodle and cabbage mixture), a stuffed cabbage, and four pierogi ( I wound up going with a potato with bacon, potato with cheese, potato with jalapeno, and potato with meat). The food was outrageously good. I\'m actually salivating just thinking back on the meal. The stuffed cabbage was not marred by the typical dryness that can afflict that dish and was perfectly sauced. The haluski, a dish I had never heard of, was amazing.\n\nWhile I can\'t expect everyone to make their way to Pittsburgh solely to go to Pierogies Plus, do yourself a favor and order some. Those wonderful ladies deserve your business. Your belly will appreciate it!', positive, 3, 0
'Little ladies, sitting in the back of a renovated gas station perched precariously at the top of a hill, making pierogies and cooking them to perfection in butter and onions... it almost sounds like a strange Pittsburgher fairy tale, but this is no tale - the finest pierogies I\'ve ever eaten emerge from the back of that gas station, and my Polish girlfriend even confirmed that these are better than some of her family\'s goods.\n\nWhile in line I met folks from Rhode Island, Kentucky, and North Carolina, who all had come to McKees Rocks in their rental cars straight from the airport before even going to see their families - that is dedication and commitment to some seriously delicious pierogies. After enjoying a dozen of these filling, savory, perfect pierogies, I think once I move away from here I will be making that same trip to Pierogies Plus myself.', positive, 3, 3
'My coworkers and I left our office in Crafton, headed for Pierogies Plus. The journey there took us past bizarre, abandoned-looking buildings, and roads that suddenly ended in cement blockades. The area is prime for use as the setting of a slasher flick. \n\nBUT, the weird drive is totally worth it. Pierogies Plus is so legit. \n\nThe setting is reminiscent of Seinfeld\'s \'Soup Nazi\': tiny interior, people standing in line shoulder-to-shoulder, and a lady behind the counter brusquely taking orders. Oh, and make sure you order your \'rogies \"hot\" if you\'re planning on eating them soon! Otherwise, you get \'em frozen. (There\'s a slight up-charge for the hot ones, btw -- electricity ain\'t free!) \n\nThey were out of the plain potato and the potato and cheese varieties when we were there, so I had the platter with pierogies and kielbasa. I opted for the sauerkraut pierogies, and they were SO good! The interior was filled with sauerkraut mixed with potatoes, as opposed to many other sauerkraut pierogies I\'ve had that were filled with only kraut. I definitely prefer the potato/kraut mix! They were also drowning in butter and onions. Like, serious, serious butter - Paula Deen has nothin\' on these ladies\' butter usage. The kielbasa was awesome, too! I also sampled their haluski and it was the best I\'ve ever had. Tons o\' butter, seasoned with generous amounts of salt \'n\' pepper, and there was quite a bit of sautéed onions in the mix, which added even more flavor. \n\nA few things to note: They have coupons you can print out on their website, but you must cut them out if you\'re gonna bring \'em in and use them! You cannot just hand them the whole piece of paper. If you want to order a special variety, they need 2 days advance notice (check their site to see what the \'special\' ones are). They do accept credit cards, with a $10 min. Yes, some of the ladies are not the friendliest, but the food is so good, they can be like that, and you\'ll still come back for more!  And, parking is quite limited there. Pretty sure the building is a converted service station. :)\n\nAll in all, these pierogies are some of the best I\'ve ever had, and I will definitely be back very soon!', positive, 1, 1

Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better.\n\nIt\'s amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies.  By 11am, the line is already out the door.  Always a good sign.  They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen.  I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions.  And here at Pierogies Plus, they are definitely worth the wait.', positive, 2, 0

'My mother is 80+ years old and now lives in New York but she grew up outside of Pittsburgh.  Her parents were Czech and our annual vacations to visit my grandparents were wonderful - filled with family dinners including stuffed cabbage, peirogies, and haluski.  Now that my mother is older and lives alone making things like stuffed cabbage is difficult for her.  I saw Peirogies Plus featured on the Food Network years ago and decided to send my mom an assortment for her birthday.  When her package arrived she called me immediately and said \"Where did you get this food???\".  This is the real deal - traditional, authentic, ethnic food.  The gift I sent took my mother back to her own mother\'s kitchen.  It\'s the comfort food to beat all comfort foods - it also takes me back to my childhood all those summers ago!

'I was very disappointed in the quality of the pierogies and the haluski at Pierogies Plus.  I ordered them hot and I purchased enough so that I could have leftovers the next day.  When I got home and opened the containers, something smelled odd.  When I started to eat, it tasted just as odd.  As it turns out, what is referred to as \'butter sauce\' is a misrepresentation of what it really is-----margarine, which I eliminated from my diet years ago because of the trans fats and the fact that any way you cut it, butter makes for a better product.  Sorry Allison B, ain\'t no butter here.  Margarine is used as a cost-cutting measure, and it just can\'t measure up.  I rinsed off the peirogies and browned them in some butter and my own onions.   The haluski got thrown away.  For the prices being charged for these products, the proprietor can well-afford to use butter.', negative, 0, 0

Shipping costs were pretty substantial, and the cooling system was VERY borderline in terms of how long it lasts, but everything looked so amazing that I was willing to chance it. :) Price wise, I think shipping is absolutely worth it as along as you order two or more of everything. Everything was so great--maybe even better than my Busha used to make! Will definitely be ordering again and again.', positive, 0, 0
'Go hungry!!  The meals are huge!  We found this place before we visited the Pittsburgh area and wanted to add it to our list of places to eat.  We were only doing mom and pop type restaurants for our vacation, no major chain restaurants.  This place fit the bill perfectly!  Like I said the meals are huge and delicious.  We got there right before closing but they still served us with a smile.  We had the #2 and the #7, both were yummy.  Those pierogies couldn\'t have had any more filling in them, they are packed with goodness.  This was the first time we have ever had Haluski, it was awesome.  We also had the nut horns for dessert.  Buy some for the car ride home!  There are a few seats outside the shop but it is mostly carry out.  Also don\'t let the neighborhood scare you, the food is worth it!!', positive, 0, 0
'Great pierogies and haluski.  A bit pricey for what you get and their deals for bulk orders are not great compared to other places (for example, Gosia\'s is better and will give you a deal on a big order).  Pierogies Plus is not the best pierogies in the city--keeping in mind there\'s a lot of competition here--but they definitely are the best Polish food in the McKees Rocks area.\n\nThe main reason that I deducted a star is because every staff member there has been incredibly rude over the phone or in person.  I got yelled at by a staff person once when I rather meekly pointed out their website prices did not match their in-store prices--not my fault the website was not up-to-date.', positive, 1, 0

'Marges is tucked away in the delightful Pittsburgh neighborhood of Mckees Rocks. This place reminds me half of a diner from the 1950\'s, and half my grandmas kitchen.\n\nThe seating room is accommodation, the service prompt and courteous.The prices are fantastic and so is the food.\n\nI had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage, potatoes, eggs, and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. It was excellent. Ladies and Gents, I can put food away  like a champ and I still had leftovers.\n\nMy friend had a succulent, buttery French Toast. Simple, but they nailed it.\n\nI would return.', positive, 0, 0
'On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge\'s Place.  I hadn\'t heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \n\nInside, it\'s bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini\'s Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don\'t have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don\'t know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \n\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \n\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge\'s Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.', positive, 2, 1

Atmosphere is loud, smokey and a bit greasy, but the delicious food is worth it. \nYou can\'t beat Marges place for a great deal. 2 eggs cooked to order, the best home fries I know of, crisp hickory bacon, Rocco\'s sausage, hot buttered Mancinis toast and vanilla French toast...$6.99\n\nI hope it never changes by going upscale or healthy ( organic, vegan etc). \n Parking meters are 10 cents an hour.', positive, 1, 0

I can\'t tell you the last time I ordered eggs over medium and actually GOT eggs over medium. No burned crusty edges or anything! And the bacon, oh the bacon, It was perfect! This place is a gem and I can\'t wait to bring my mom and sister here next time they visit. The owners RJ and Kelly were super nice and even came to check on us to make sure everything was good. They are also in the process of remodeling to give it more of a 50\'s feel.

'The true test of a great breakfast place is its ability to produce the perfect over medium egg, the whites cooked through and the yokes, unbroken, warm and runny. Many places have either produced broken or rock hard yokes (over hard) or runny whites (over easy) in their attempts to create an over medium egg, but Broadway Brunch completely nailed it!

'We decided on Sapporo after reading so-so reviews on Ichiban and Benihana\'s.  This was a nice surprise. Yes, it is not in the best looking area, and yes, the restaurant may not be as nice as a Benihana.  But the food was quite good.  \n\nWe had our doubts at first.  We went in the middle of a Sunday afterfoon and the place was empty.  And service seemed to be a little disorganized and distracted.  But once the chef came out and got to work, it was great.  The salad and soup were veyr good, the soup being a little more beefy in flavor than what we were used to.  We then had the fried rice and got a HUGE portion.  We needed a little more soy sauce that what the chef used, but he gladly provided more and the rice was delicious.  \n\nThen we moved to the main entrees.  Wife had the Chateaubriand and I had the Tenderloin and Scallops.  The meat, although cooked  just a tad past medium, still melted in your mouth,and the scallops were absolutely the best I\'ve ever had!!  Again, huge portions of meat and vegetables, plus a large portion of noodles. Definitely a plateful.\n\nWe did not get the requisite show you get at this kind of restaurant, but we\'ve seen it so many times, it\'s kinda boring to me.  Instead, we had a nice conservsation with the chef about the Pittsburgh area.  All in all, this was a very pleasant meal, and I\'ll definitely go back.', positive, 1, 0
'I travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of Hibachi restaurants. I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my co-workers. I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same. The typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly.  I found Sapporo and was very pleased! It is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style. My party felt the staff was very friendly.\n\nI had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. We all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty good size. I didn\'t want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner. Our Chef was one of the most personable Chef\'s I have encountered. He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. My file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent. They make their fried rice from scratch. It\'s not prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places. I can definitely tell the difference. My friend Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used. It is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. Dan, who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldn\'t even finish it. Actually we all needed to-go boxes. The portion amount here is incredible. You definitely get your money\'s worth here!!\n\nI would highly recommend this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh. I can not stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places. I think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which I can always appreciate. \n\nThank you Sapporo for a great Hibachi experience!! I will be back for sure!\n\nAnh', positive, 0, 0
'The food was alright. Not good. Not bad. And considering the portion, the prices weren\'t bad either. The service, on the other hand, was terrible. Severely understaffed. Three hours order to check.

'Sapporo is my favorite Japanese restaurant, period. I\'ve found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. \n\nSapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike\'s hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don\'t let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There\'s a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There\'s also that karaoke machine I\'ve never seen used in all the years I\'ve gone here.\n\nUnlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren\'t all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it\'s all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it\'s fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that\'s neither here nor there.\n\nThe food here is excellent. They\'ve introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don\'t know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I\'m not sure if they\'re using it for anything other than just what\'s on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I\'m not aware of.\n\nAt any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It\'s a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I\'ve had it, so I\'m not a real stickler when it comes to that.\n\nUsually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it\'s a great dish. I\'ve also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.\n\nNow, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the \"magic sauce.\" It\'s of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I\'m always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don\'t have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn\'t come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it\'s a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.\n\nSo if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It\'s amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don\'t care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.\n\nSapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn\'t have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.\n\nThe steak here is great. I\'ve had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.\n\nI\'m not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo\'s a funny place in that some weeknights you\'ll drive by and it\'s packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I\'d suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was \"packed\" I\'ve never had to wait long to be seated at a table.\n\nSo if you haven\'t been, give Sapporo a try. It\'s been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don\'t do lunches anymore, so it\'s strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids\' meals. It\'s not some place you would go frequently if you\'re on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.', positive, 2, 0
'Been to many hibachis, this one is very clean, the building is a little older but the family that runs it does a wonderful job. \n\nI came here and got the chicken. Spot on, I loved the beef stew it came with- I always think the salad at hibachis are real alright- but the sushi was delicious and the hibachi was wonderful with delicious noodles , veggies, and rice- best I have had in a while because it ain\'t too salty- many times for me it\'s too extreme on the salt.\n\nFree edamame with check in so that was a plus. \n\nReasonably priced delicious Japanese goodness- seemed like it also had good drinks.\n\nWill return.', positive, 0, 0
'My boyfriend and I are practically Hibachi connoisseurs so when we visited Pittsburgh for the weekend the first thing we Yelp searched was.. you guessed it, Hibachi! Sapporo was highly rated so we went for dinner on a Saturday night.\n\nThe restaurant is located in front of a dimly lit motel but don\'t be discouraged by the facade because once you step inside the door the atmosphere is warm and inviting. \n\nWe were greeted by the owner\'s daughter who sat us at an empty table while we waited for the other guests to join us. The owner\'s son brought us menus to look over and informed us that Sapporo is a family-run establishment. The table quickly filled with regulars who said that Sapporo was their favorite Hibachi restaurant in Pittsburgh, one couple even said that they come for dinner every single Saturday evening. The owner himself came over to our table and began cooking our meal!\n\nI ordered the Hibachi chicken and broccoli in Sapporo special sauce and my boyfriend ordered the Hibachi shrimp and chicken, both with fried rice. Both meals were good but the special sauce on my chicken was absolutely delicious! Definitely one of the best Hibachi chicken variation that I have tasted and my boyfriend really enjoyed how flavorful his shrimp tasted. The chef, a Korean war veteran, was engaging in our conversation and made you feel as if you were over a friend\'s house for dinner.\n\nWe both agreed that we will definitely return to Sapporo the next time that we are in Pittsburgh.', positive, 4, 0

'I have been a fan of Ricci Italian Sausage for as long as I can remember.  My Italian aunts - love Ricci\'s too. The new location is now in Kennedy Township... located conveniently in the Kenmar Plaza - next to Subway.   The Robinson location is now closed.  I am thrilled about the move its closer to my home.   Hot Sausage, Sweet Sausage, Meatballs etc.   There are frozen food items available too - pasta, sauce, meatballs etc. There is also a shelf in the store stocked with sausage buns, sauce and other items.  I often stop after work to grab dinner because they are open until 6:00.    Specials:  Pazzo Monday: any sandwich or  1/2 sausage roll with a soft drink is $5.99.  Tuesday/Thursday: Mac and Cheese with ground hot sausage $2.75 per serving.   Friday: Sherrys Pasta e\'Fagoli $3.75 per serving Wednesday/Saturday: (MY FAVORITE SPECIAL):  Homemade Lasagna - made with homemade sauce, Tallutos lasagna pasta, grande and lamagna cheese and ricci ground hot sausage $4.25 per serving.  I must tell you that the lasagna is my favorite menu item at Ricci and anytime I get it .. when I eat it.. I get into a \"zone\". And I don\'t ever share.. yes it\'s THAT good.\n\nI love to make my own spaghetti sauce using Ricci Italian Sausage.  I have tried using other types of sausages - like giant eagle brand but you can always tell when its \"Ricci\'s Sausage\" because it\'s a good batch of sauce and everyone raves about it.    \n\n\nmangia mangia', positive, 1, 1
'Called for an arrangement for pickup, told the person who took my order that I would be able to pick the arrangement up at 5:30pm.

She said ok.  \n\nComes to be 5pm and I get a call from a guy at the shop asking where I was!  The lady who took my order wrote down that I\'d be there at 5pm.  I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \n\nArrangement was just OK.

'I ordered my fiance a small, fall arrangement. It was supposed to be full of gerber daisies, with each one costing around $3.

'I would give our experience zero stars. Possible negative stars. It\'s Valentine\'s Day. An order was placed weeks in advance for a delivery. My boyfriend went to the shop to ask where the delivery was and the woman at the counter could not have cared less that he was perturbed. Weather conditions are not ideal for deliveries today but no attempt was made to communicate that the delivery would be delayed. Just a little \"hey, someone is sending you something special, we\'re doing the best we can\". Placate us! \n\nI received a call at 5:30 saying I needed to be home to receive the delivery! Where\'s the surprise in that? What if it\'s just a regular day and I\'m getting surprise flowers, would I have to get them myself if I wasn\'t home? Well, my flowers are not being delivered today. My arrangement is sitting at the shop because I was chosen to be the loser of \"who gets their flowers on time\". \n\nThe surprise of my arrangement was also ruined by the shop when they said what it was, how beautiful it was and I\'d be very happy. Well, we\'re not happy at all about the service. At all. Don\'t know how this place is still in business with the awful customer service.\n\n\nEdit: my flowers were delivered at 1:05 on 2/15 after I told the shop they needed to be delivered by 1:00. They were given a range of 9-1. I was offered a box of Whitman\'s chocolate as an apology. Really? How about a refund.

'Frankfurters has only been open a few weeks, but it already has the feel of a hangout, the staff is welcoming and friendly - you\'ll find yourself chatting with other diners before you know it.

We had the Chicago-style (tons of veggies and peppers, \"dragged through the garden\"), and the Chef with kraut and mustard, along with a small order or fries, definitely large enough for two people.

'Meh. I\'ve ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven\'t had pizza from this place yet!\n\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\n\nThe seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn\'t quite eat it; I\'m wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren\'t that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \"I taste like iodine\" flavor.\n\nThe advantage to R&B is that they\'re open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver.

'I stopped by here two nights ago as part of a night where I would try three different pizzas in the Bellevue/Avalon area.  I called my order in for an XL pizza ahead of time and was told that I would have a 15 minute wait until it was ready.  Since I only had a general idea of where it was located I ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in a small strip mall right next to Lincoln Ave.  There isn\'t too much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have a counter up front with a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating, not that this is a bad thing.\n\nPizzas in general can be broken down into three separate components: cheese, crust and sauce.  This pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of all of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me.  The cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had a nice spice profile (strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano?) coming through it.  The crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had a little crisp which I loved.  \n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back to R & B\'s again in the future for pizza.  It was easily the most expensive of the bunch that I bought last night at $12.79 after tax for an XL but as the old adage goes \"You get what you pay for\" and if you like garlic then you should like this pizza.', positive, 0, 0

Always exceedingly friendly, and happy to accommodate any special requests. Sadly, we\'re moving out of the area in two weeks, so we won\'t be able to continue our tradition.

When I was a kid, the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza, but they\'ve since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is still just as good.  I prefer the thin-crust, but the Sicilian is also excellent.  The fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great, too.  The calzones are tasty, but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone, you\'ll be disappointed.  Because it\'s Pittsburgh, the chicken salad comes with french fries.  I tend to opt for take-out, but there is also a mid-sized dining section.', positive, 2, 0

'I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi\'s was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi\'s many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn\'t immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \"Stay out of trouble\".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi\'s in the future.  I just don\'t see myself making a trip to Luigi\'s between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.', negative, 0, 0

'Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind.

Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that\'s the only way to describe it. I\'ll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that\'s how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren\'t there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future.

'My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new \'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn\'t last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied.

'TERRIBLE! No one expects fast food to be gourmet, but this experience would make corporate cry! Ordered food for 2 adults (full meals) and for one child and was charged for 2 more adult meals, I asked why the amount was so high and the employee said nothing to me, looked the other way and yelled for a manager. Still feeling over charged but not wanting to agitate the situation any further we left with 1 less drink then we ordered, cold food and a soda water instead of sprite because no one changed the syrup.

'Small vet clinic just off of Rt. 65 in Avalon offers friendly service and extremely reasonable prices.

'For over 20 years the Avalon Veterinary Hospital staff has treated my pets: cats, rabbits, fish, and a turtle.  The prices are very reasonable, and I\'ve never been charged for follow-ups.\n\nDr. Fitzgerald provided an affordable diabetes treatment plan for my cat to prolong his life; the prognosis went from a few months to three healthy years.  When my cat suddenly had kidney failure from diabetic shock, I was only charged for the treatment--not the emergency appointment fees. The staff was extremely considerate when my cat passed--some who knew him were even crying.\n\nMy other cat gained a reputation as a menace.  But the staff never complained--not even when she required four people to hold her down just to get her shots.\n\nWhen I was sold a diseased turtle a a child, Dr. Moore was very kind and did not charge for the visit nor the medication.  He recognized my interest in science and patiently answered all of my 11-year-old questions.  He even showed me how he made slides and how his microscope worked. (I later studied biology and worked as a lab tech, so thanks.)  Dr. Moore also took exemplary care of our rabbits, who all lived unusually long lives.\n\nOn a practical note, they require ALL animals to be in a cage or on a leash.  I once had a well-behaved cat, who was too sick to chase the dogs, wrapped in a blanket since his collar would have been over an open wound...But they generally enforce the cage/leash policy for the safety of all animals.

The staff remembered him and loved seeing him visit.  \n\nI\'ve recently taken my cat here, who has a growth on his arm.  He has to have it removed, which Dr. Bigger explained can be done there and quoted me an EXTREMELY reasonable price.  \n\nI am so pleased with the services my pets have gotten at the Avalon Vet I wouldn\'t think of going elsewhere.  The staff and the vets are all extremely friendly and knowledgable.  \n\nThe only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that it location is pretty small, and the exam rooms are only divided by curtains (no doors).

The vet simply wrote \"meows too much on\" on the chart and prescribed Valium. \n\nHoping to get a different vet next time I took my other cat there. Everyone is always very kind and loving to him, but it always takes the vet at least 40 minutes past the appointment time to see him. Not to mention, they are always so overbooked that I am forced to sit in the waiting area with at least 4 barking dogs at once. Their owners try to calm them, but my cat shudders and shakes in his cage and I am unable to hold him and comfort him. You try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs.

'Do not take your pet here! If you are new don\'t bother establishing a relationship. If you have been there in the past, be warned, it\'s under new ownership and all of the doctors and vet techs that have been there for decades are gone. Prices have increased dramatically with the new owners. My pet\'s annual visit was over well $100. Outside of annual exams office visits are more than $50 and that does not include anything they may do (shots, tests, blood work) and exclusive of the hazardous waste disposal charge. Also, they quit carrying a lot of medicines and clients are now forced to use a mail order pharmacy. I was a loyal client to Avalon Vet for my whole life, but the changes I\'ve seen in the past year are absurd. Prices increased, cameras everywhere, hiring vets that have decades of bad reputations around this area. Not to mention I had to argue with the manager to get a copy of my pet\'s records. The last thing the establishment, under the new owners, cares about are their client\'s pets.\n\nAlso, do not take their Facebook page seriously.

'The only vet I will use from now on! The staff is amazing! From the receptionist to the vet. It really does take a team to provide great service. I was bringing my cat in as a new patient with concerns about his back leg. They fit me in the next day! I called them at 4:30 pm on Monday and they had me in Tuesday at 5:30! This alone was amazing on account that the vet I use to take him to never returned my calls. The vet (Kouch I maybe spelling that wrong) was so patient with my not so happy cat. She diagnosed the issue. It was his poor back. They filled a prescription, updated his shots, and didn\'t run any test that weren\'t necessary. I want to trust the vet to provide the care that my animal needs, not run me through the ringer. I will do anything for my cat. For them to be honest about what is necessary and what\'s not put my mind at ease that he was getting the treatment he needed and no unnecessary test that would only stress him out.  Great job! Hopefully we will be back for just shots but if anything else does come up you will be seeing me and tyty again.', positive, 2, 0

'They do NOT care about animals.  I had been taking bothof my dogs there for 4 years for regular veterinary care. My youngest dog came down with stomach cancer while I was unemployed, she needed to be euthanized and I made an appointment, put my poor bloated sick dog into the car and took her for her final visit.  They demanded I pay up front before she was even seen by a vet and I asked for billing, having been a years-long patient who has always paid I didn\'t think it would be an issue, especially considering the pain my dog was in.  They refused to do the euthanization and would rather leave a sick animal (years long animal patient of theirs! ) in pain and suffering than to do the courtesy of sending a bill to a regular customer.  DISGUSTING.   Who does that? Never will I take another animal there, I now have a new vet that actually cares about animals and how they feel and whether they are in pain.\n\nUPDATED FEB 2016: Owner of this veterinary practice finally figured out what Yelp is and contacted me for details about my experience.  I provided her with the necessary information and she harassed me implying my dog was not a regular patient because there were a few years that she didn\'t have a visit.  Well no, she was in good  health and didn\'t need to be seen. Regardless she had been seen there at least 5 times since 2008.  That was who we considered our vet.  She then insisted my dog HAD been euthanized there (SHE WAS NOT ) and asked me to change or remove my Yelp review even though I had asked her to please stop contacting me because I didn\'t want to have to emotionally relive this HORRIFIC experience every time she contacted me.  I am not changing my review nor am I removing it.  This review was the truth of what happened. So if that gives you a little more insight into how this business is run, there you have it.

'Please please read!  They do not care about animals, at all.  They used to be owned by wonderful people, but now they are owned by people who care about money and not your animal.  We took our dog here for surgery for bladder stones and less than 2 months later she died because she was \"full of cancer\"!  How did this vet miss this on blood work and when they performed surgery on this dog?? Shady to me!  After the surgery, when our dog fell ill, we took her in to be seen, it was obvious she was in dire condition.  The vet here did testing only to recommend taking the dog to a speciality hospital, because she needed a sonogram and they don\'t have that equipment.  It was obvious that someone needed to look inside the dog to see what was the matter!   Did the vet not know what she was doing or did she do the uneccesary tests to make money?  Either way the result was the same.  Please I want to save someone from the awful pain of what has happened to me.', negative, 2, 0

Only then, after you performed unnecessary tests did you tell him about the specialty hospital. The care you provided our dog was awful and I hope no one has to go thru what we did.

I did notice that the flowers were loose inside the tissue paper and I asked the cashier for ribbon to tie them together and she said to me..\"Well, we sell ribbon\".  Humph!  I also absolutely must mention that she was training another gal on this while transaction so she was not new.

'I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn\'t show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn\'t received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn\'t jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \"Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven\'t left, but you should just call back to reschedule.\'  Seriously?

'Now I\'m picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.\n\nI had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \"difficult\" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \"Locks of Love,\" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.

One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \"wasn\'t looking right.\"  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client\'s hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\n\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \"I have to leave, so sorry \"as I bolted for the door.', negative, 2, 1

My hair is very fine and I don\'t have a whole lot of it, but Sue does wonders with it, especially with my latest cut. I never wanted it shorter than shoulder length, but decided recently to make a change. Because I\'m getting older, and other methods of increasing the volume and amount of my hair were too expensive, or didn\'t work,  I wanted to try a shorter cut. The cut she gave me made my hair look much thicker. I have had several compliments on the cut, one from another hairstylist who worked at Regis. Sue is also reasonable, charging $80 for my cut and hi-lights. I will admit that I had to wait outside the salon once when I was the first customer of the day, but that was once in over 5 years.

'Krispy Creme? Grocery store cakes?  Git ahta tahn.... when it comes to donuts, pastries, and cakes they don\'t hold a wisk to Lincoln Bakery in Bellevue (or most Western PA bakeries for that matter).

'In one word, unbelievable. Their cakes are incredibly delicious. Despite the 20 minute trip from my house, I purchase all my cakes from here. The cakes are incredibly moist and the butter cream icing is just the right amount of sweet. My favorite cake is a yellow cake with FUDGE icing (not chocolate but FUDGE)!! I\'ve also had the raspberry filling and would recommend that as well. They are incredibly creative with their decorating of the cakes including wedding cakes but if you want something specialized (nonstandard icing, etc) be sure to call ahead and place your order in advance. Warning: Saturday mornings you will surely encounter a very, very long line whether picking up your order or just swinging by for some goodies. \n\nEven better than their cakes are their petit-fours (chocolate with chocolate icing or white with vanilla icing). I\'ve ordered them for bridal showers or just stopped by to pick one up for myself. They are the perfect size for one person (if you aren\'t on a diet). They do sell out of these so place an order ahead of time if you want a large order or stop by early in the morning to make sure you can get them. \n\nI\'ve gotten cookies from here and they were average. I think this is the best bakery in the Burgh for cakes but not necessarily all other pastries and breads. \n\nThe only reason I didn\'t rate the bakery 5 stars is their customer service which is borderline horrific. They are never friendly and whether you are calling to place an order or standing at the counter, they just want to get the order taken and move on to the next person in line.

For fall cakes and cupcakes, I can\'t even imagine anyone making anything prettier!  The icing is wonderful, although the colored icing is sort of bitter (but I think that is the case anywhere).  The white icing is just perfect and not too sweet.  When I told my neighbor that I was coming here tonight to pick up the cake, she immediately asked me if I had ever had the carrot cake.  Yes, I have, and it is amazing!  The burnt almond torte rivals Prantl\'s.  I think the girls who work there are so nice and helpful.  And I love all of the homemade candy that they sell.

Feel like it ruined an otherwise lovely cake. \n\nThere was a wide selection of cookies, cakes (large and individual sizes) and fresh-baked donuts. I\'ll be back to try more from this local bakery, just be wary about getting cakes iced on the spot!', positive, 0, 0
'Lincoln Bakery is a top notch bakery in the Pittsburgh area which I feel is on par with other high ranking bakeries in the area such as Prantls and Oakmont Bakery.  I love that they have slices of many of their cakes and cheesecakes available for individual purchase.  I purchased an assortment of these to take to a dinner party and they were all gobbled up and it was a great way to allow everyone to try small bites of a variety of treats.  My personal favorite was the Chocolate Mousse cake because I love chocolate and it was sweet without being overly sweet, creamy, with the right balance of sweet and bitter from the chocolate.  I also sampled the tiramisu which was delicate with just a hint of espresso and the cream was perfect.  The best thing was that while the desserts were all obviously sweet they weren\'t so sweet that it was sickening as I\'ve experienced with more commercial cakes from grocery or big box stores.  The other cakes that I bought and all of which the dinner attendees loved were the lemon cake, the oreo cheesecake, one called the sweet spot that had chocolate and peanut butter, and finally a white cake with chocolate frosting.  It is close to my neighborhood so I will definitely return the next time that I need baked goods for a special occasion.  They are closed on Sunday, but the great thing is that they have extended hours the rest of the week until 8 PM M-F and until 7 PM on Saturdays.', positive, 2, 2

'We got our wedding cake from here and had TONS of compliments on it.  It was very delicious.  My biggest complaints when it comes to cake, is when it is dried out, but that was definitely not the case here.  The icing was phenomenal too.  I hate when icing is too sugary and sweet, but once again Lincoln bakery didn\'t disappoint.  \nSince I currently live in Bellevue, we often times take a walk down here on our Saturday mornings in the warm months to pick out a delicious breakfast treat.  We\'ve had their coffee cakes, their donuts, muffins, cinnamon rolls,  and plenty of other things.  They\'ve all been pretty good.  They\'re never anything out of this world or amazing, but good, solid, bakery products, and since the prices are so wonderful, I really can\'t complain.  Actually, while I\'m writing this review, I\'m starting to think maybe a walk this coming Saturday is in order for breakfast.  mmmmm', positive, 0, 0
'I ordered my wedding cake from the Lincoln Bakery and was very pleased with the results.  My cake--and I\'m not just being partial here--was the tastiest wedding cake I ever had.  As I lived in another state at the time, my mom went to sample the cakes and was given exceptionally large samples--in fact, she was given entire cakes.  We ended up going with a yellow cake with alternating tiers of fresh strawberry and lemon filling.  The staff was helpful, and adaptable when I inevitably changed my mind about the design.  The bakery was able to delivery the cake to my location, and it arrived fresh.  Unlike most wedding cakes, this cake was incredibly moist, and the buttercream icing was smooth and not overly sweet (which I hate).  My venue saved the top tier; my husband and I didn\'t wait until our first anniversary to eat it--we ate it that week!  Highly recommend.', positive, 0, 0

'I stopped into Discount Tire Center on 65 in Bellevue because one of my tires was slowly dying.  I had planned to get two new tires.  Admittedly, this place looks a little scary...to me anyhow, but as a girl by herself all garages are pretty intimidating.  I didn\'t know how these things worked...did I need to call ahead for an appt?  I needed new tires ASAP, so an appt wasn\'t an option.  Luckily, the guys at Discount Tire Center took great care of me.  \n\nI pulled in, hesitantly got out of my car and wandered into the garage.  A man promptly greeted me and asked me what he could do.  I asked for two new tires, he took a quick look at my car and told me, \"No problem, pull it in\".  \n\nHe discussed the options of tires in a way I could understand, giving his suggestions but ultimately leaving the decision up to me.  He also let me know about a rebate on 4 tires, which I ended up getting (after a frantic call to my husband asking if I was stupid for being upsold).  It ended up being a great deal and I never felt pressured to buy more.\n\nI sat in the waiting area (which could use a woman\'s touch to be sure) for about 10 minutes and they were done.  SO FAST!  The man explained everything with the rebate and I left a happy camper.  \n\nI will absolutely be back to Discount Tire Center in the future.', positive, 2, 0
'If you just need tires, and want a quick, no-hassle experience, then this is your place. \n\nDrove in, and the guys immediately asked if I was looking for a cheap option or a higher quality option. I was planning on replacing all my tires, but then they suggested that I only need rear tires as the front ones still had about \"50\% good tread.\"  They seemed to be actively interested in saving me money.  \n\nThey only replaced the tires and didn\'t look for any other \"potential problems\" with brakes, rotors, bearings or anything else wheel related. Which is both a blessing and a curse, depending on the level of service you are looking for. But like I said, if you just want tires, and don\'t want to break the bank, then this is your place.', positive, 1, 1

I appreciated that and I\'ve had no more issues with my tire. \n\nI will definitely go back here for future tire needs.', positive, 0, 0

Look no further!\n\nMy wife badly needed new tires so we went to all the local spots to compare prices, Mr Tire, Pep Boys, Sam\'s Club, Flynn\'s etc. While leaving Flynn\'s a woman flagged us down and asked if we needed tires and told us about Discount Tire.\n\nA few days later we decided to give them a try. We went with a new Continental Tire that had just hit the market that came highly recommended by the service guy. What\'s really cool is that they are like a Nascar Pit Crew. There are actually four guys working on your vehicle at the same time taking the old tires off and mounting, balancing and putting the new ones on.\n\nLess than fifteen minutes later they were done and our car was better than new! The car rides so much better and going over bumps and pot holes is so much more comfortable. Don\'t put off getting new tires and give this place a shot!', positive, 3, 1

Not too expensive either because they don\'t try to sell you all the \"bells and whistles\" that other tire places try to sell you (ehem mr. Tire). I had been quoted a price of around $700 for tires from other places but discount tire got them on for only $360. From now on, I won\'t be going anywhere else for tires!', positive, 0, 0

'I don\'t think there\'s anyone that likes to buy tires, but if you have to then I highly suggest you purchase them from Discount Tire Center. Conveniently located near the McKees Rock Bridge, this should be the only place you consider when in need of a tire replacement. The open at 7a, but I arrived closer to 6:50. What really impressed me was that they opened the service bay door before their scheduled open time! Seriously, it\'s rare to find a place that will do this for a customer. I only had to get one tire replaced and was out of the shop in 15 minutes. Plus, the cost of the tire was a lot less than going to other tire places. To be completely honest, I really don\'t want to have to purchase another tire for a long time, but if I have to I will go here.', positive, 1, 1
'Another awesome experience at Discount Tire Center to share with the Yelp community!\n\nOne of my rear tires had a slow leak. Instead of just taking it into these guys, I kept filling the sucker up every couple days. In all honesty,  I was being a bit cheap and just didn\'t want to spend the hundred bucks. \n\nWouldn\'t ya know, as I was filling the tire yesterday I noticed that a shiny nail had punctured the tire. So, I finally gave in and went back to Discount Tire this morning.\n\nThis was my second time here in the past couple months and the service was just as great as the last time. I was worried I might have to buy a new tire, but they were able to fix both nail punctures. Yep! There were two nails in the tire that were causing the slow leak.\n\nHere\' s the best part. The total cost for the repair was only $15 flat.\n\nIf you have any tire issues, just go here. You will not be disappointed.', positive, 0, 0
'Beware!!! I decided to come here based on all the positive reviews.

When I pulled up to the store however, they immediately refused to sell me two tires saying that they cannot do that on a Subaru and instead attempted to upsell me four new tires.  Classic bait and switch.\n\nSTAY AWAY!!!\n\nEdit: To their credit, Jason did reach out to me to apologize and attempt to explain the company policy (which shows me that they care).

'The only word I can use to describe my experience at Discount Tire Center is.... WOW!   I found this place thanks to a verbal reference from my Brother-In-Law.  I decided to check them out on Yelp before calling to get prices and saw all of the positive reviews.  I\'m here to tell you that this place is awesome!\n\nFirst, let\'s start with the price.  I needed 4 tires for my Town and Country.  I had done some shopping around for prices and these guys were less than everyone else by about $50.00.  On top of that, there also happened to be a $40.00 mail-in rebate for the tires I purchased but they can\'t really control manufacturer discounts so I can\'t give them credit for that.  My point is, based on price alone; I had to give them a shot.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about my experience.  I called over before I went in to ask exactly how long it would take to have the tires installed.  I explained that I could take a long lunch break but anything longer than 2 hours wouldn\'t work.  They explained that there weren\'t any other customers there at the moment, but with them being an appointment-free shop it was hard to say how long it would take.  I decided to take the chance and headed over on my lunch hour.  I arrived at about 12:05 and expected that I\'d need to park, go in, talk about a price, etc.  To my surprise, I pulled up and they waved me right into one of the garage doors.  I got out of my car and a guy met me at the door and started talking tires.  The very first real question was, am I looking for inexpensive or top-of the-line tires.  It seemed to me that they weren\'t going to even bother pricing the expensive tires if I simply wasn\'t interested.  Being my family vehicle I explained that I wanted \"Just under\" top-of-the-line.  I then explained that I called in a few days prior and someone priced out a set of GoodYear tires for me.  \n\nThe conversation took all of about 2 minutes.  The gentleman then promptly communicated the tires I wanted and a team of 6 guys went to work.  Before I could get my phone out to snap a picture all four tires were off of the car and on their way to having the old tires removed.  In the end, I had paid and was driving away at 12:30.... I kid you not!  It was like having my own pit crew!  It was so quick that when I arrived home (I was working from home that day) my wife was shocked.\n\nIn closing, I can\'t imagine not going back to these guys for my next set of tires.  The price was awesome and the service was out of this world.  On top of that, they didn\'t try to sell me anything that I didn\'t need or want!  I\'d recommend calling in to see how many people are in line.  Obviously if there had been four cars being worked on I\'d have had less people to work on my car but I can\'t imagine the service being slow considering how efficient their operation is.', positive, 1, 1

I was there this morning, I was back at my home within 25 minutes of having pulled into their garage.

As soon as I picked the tire I wanted, they went to town. I\'d say I was in and out under 10 minutes with great tires and saved over 100 DOLLARS.

'My beef was so raw that I had to put it in the microwave for two minutes. It was even slightly cold before I reheated it. The manager says they cook it medium rare, and I explained it was so rare it ate the lettuce off of the sandwich! \n\nNeither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the BLT had much bacon. (How do I post pictures?) For a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon, this fell WAY short. The little bit of bacon it did have was burnt. Really Arby\'s? I told the manager I have no idea how they thought sending out a sandwich like that was acceptable.\n\nOverall, this made a horrible day worse. I was celebrating my two oldest girls\' graduation from high school, and what was supposed to be a very nice dinner was a disaster. We went to Arby\'s as a back up so I had at least a little something to eat. That was equally disastrous. At least the fries were okay, albeit a little soft and mushy for some reason. \n\nBased on this experience, I would not go back.

'Wow. An actual neighborhood grocery store. Not the wannabe monopoly monster bird ripping people off left and right, but an actual neighborhood grocery store.\n\nIf you\'re seeking the gourmet fancy-schmancy, or the self-restrictive dietary vegan-gluten-free blah blah blah, your choices may be a little more limited, but if you\'re a \'normal\' eater, it\'s a grocery store that has all of the basics and a few frills. No one will speak to you with a fake Hampton accent dahhhhhling, and you won\'t find a wine-tasting class with a gourmet fritter exhibition.\n\nWhat you will find are regular folk who are helpful and (mostly) friendly, the usual grocery store variety of necessities and non-necessities, a nicely stocked and priced meat and produce case, a deli counter with the usual meats and cheeses and a variety of prepared foods, baked goods. It\'s clean and tidy, and you can stock your fridge and pantry as you see fit, and with a pleasant \'How ya doin\'?\'\n\nKuhn\'s still does the double-coupon thing, and they have some pretty good sales - ten boxes of pasta for ten bucks, the weekly soda sales - three fridge packs for nine bucks beats monster bird\'s $12.\n\nNow I will say that on occasion, it will feel a little like you\'ve somehow been sucked into deep Appalachia in regard to some of the clientele, but that\'s pretty much everywhere in da burgh that\'s on the \'outskirts\'. Sometimes I look around me and half expect to find a rusty 1950\'s pick up truck full of goats in the parking lot, or a trailer park nearby.\n\nI generally do my \'staple\' shopping at Aldi, and my meat needs in the Strip, but for a nearby quick fill in, unless it\'s an ingredient for a specialty recipe, Kuhn\'s is great for the \'Oh crap - I need\' kind of trip.\n\nAnd quite frankly, as nice as they are, and decently priced as they are, this small business deserves our business more than the cut throat monster bird.', positive, 1, 1

I\'ve gotten month-old expired milk here before and don\'t even get me started on the moldy Yoplait. Second of all, and more important, the service here is terrible. The employees here act like they are forced to work here, and if you are using a card, be prepared to slide it at least three of four times since the employees are too incompetent to eat anything right the first time.

'Without question, this is my favorite thrift store in the greater Pittsburgh region. I find antique kitchenwares here that are older than my grandma, worth $85 if the antique mall is to be believed, and priced at $2.50. The 50\%-off sales actually pay off here. The merchandise turns over quickly. The staff is a real cast of characters (don\'t miss the steelers tattoos!!! i\'m seriously serious, they are amazing). there are bicycles for you and your kids in decent-semi-working condition. The balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. The prices are reasonable to cheap. The plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. The kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. Most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. The remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot. \n\nI have spent, cumulatively, probably  several weeks of my life in this store.

'So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears.  First, I\'ll walk you through my experience. \n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you\'re looking for without the size separation.  But, I\'m not one to abandon a bargain because I don\'t want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \nI couldn\'t take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn\'t even see if it would fit). \n\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don\'t plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you\'d better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can\'t return or exchange your items, so you\'d be out of luck and out of money.', negative, 3, 1
'Woo Hoo!  Dead Lady.\n\nThis thrift store rocks.  I have been doing this for more years that I haven\'t been, and it is the best in the city.\n\nI would make a weekly trek to RWB, and would never be disappointed.  These were the days when you could find a vintage 50s something or other on the racks, before there was a \"Vintage\" section.  Still, recently, there is always a treasure to be had, especially in the housewares department.  The proximity of this thrift store to the affluent neighborhood of Sewickley accounts for its top-notch merch.  Whenever we\'d have a particularly good day, my frends and I would joke...\"dead lady.\"', positive, 2, 1
'I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.\n\n1. It\'s well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You\'re never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you\'ve just bought.\n\n2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they\'ve laundered everything thoroughly. \n\n3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It\'s mainly items along these lines.  You\'re more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you\'re over the age of 21 is a good thing.\n\n4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it\'s addictive.  You never know what you\'ll find.\n\nA summary of a few things I\'ve bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker\'s bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....\n\nYou get the picture.

I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico\'s, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!\n\nThe clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.\n\nI went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!\n\nCome to this thrift store; it\'ll make all other shopping obsolete!', positive, 2, 0
'I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50\% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh!', negative, 2, 0
'Ever shopped at a Thrift Shop that sells high end labels, some brand new and gently used items like backpacks for $5? This is a great place to discover unique things. They also have daily deals such as 1/2 off of certain color tags. Have to dig through other things though to find something interesting which is part of the adventure!', positive, 1, 0
'First time i really took a moment to look for some stuff. It\'s always a Hit or miss, all the other thrift store I\'ve visited later in my trip showed me that. Thrift store sure does drain a lot of your mental energy. Looking for stuff there was a hellacious project but I bought a Steeler jersey for 2.50$, some polos and a cute outfit for a friends baby. 20$ before reduction and after 7.90$!! wohh!!

'I love a deal, and this has been my favorite thrift store since I was a kid.  \n\nFirst, there is some sort of half-off deal every day.\n\nSecond, the used book selection is pretty decent.  Yeah, there are a ton of self-help and Patterson mass markets that you have wade through, but T.C. Boyle for two bucks?  Yes, please.\n\nThird, the home goods.  I\'ve gotten huge solid wood picture frames for only a couple dollars.  The art prints inside were hideous...but I threw those away, re-stained the frames to my liking, cut new mats, and inserting art quoted as $360 each to frame at a big chain fabric store for under $30.  Boom.\n\nFinally, there is a decent selection of lamp to re-wire, always lot of furniture, some diamond in the rough clothes on occasion, and lots of other wacky stuff that\'s just fun to sift through.\n\nCASH ONLY and the cashiers are pretty rude/lazy, but that never bothers me.\n\nBONUS:  They pick up your donations for free from your porch.  http://www.pickupplease.org/  Super easy.', positive, 3, 3
'I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It\'s such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. \n\nSo the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you \%50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn\'t believe it. I was too excited.\n\nThe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don\'t wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that\'s just as good at the same price. \n\nShopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!! I\'ll probably never shop retail again!!\n\nREMINDER: CASH ONLY!!\n-But they have an ATM!! $2.50 fee', positive, 3, 2
'Rating this store is tough because I want to give it a 5...I really do.\nHuge selection of clothing, housewares, electronics and furniture, but NO FITTING ROOMS!\n\nYes, you read that correctly. No fitting rooms. Are you kidding me?!?! It doesn\'t completely overshadow the fact that they have great items, but when 95\% of what you offer is clothing, you\'ve got to have a few rooms for people to try stuff on!\n\nThe clothing is organized by style and color, not by size, so be ready to dig. Same thing with the shoes.\n\nI asked a staff member where to try on clothing and she directed me to the back corner of the store where there were two long mirrors hanging side by side on the wall, directly in front of the kitchen section. I was slightly confused for a minute and then realized that was my only option. I decided against even peeking at any pants or blouses and instead went for jackets and sweaters I could easily try on over my shirt. \n\nNow, the mirrors are directly side-by-side, so if there are two people trying things on over their clothes (so weird), you\'re going to be right up on top of them. Not to mention you\'ll be right on top of people browsing through the kitchen section.\n\nA lady I was chatting with told me that she has seen women come in wearing tight fitting shirts/tank tops and spandex tights (hey, those are somehow socially acceptable as pants in public now, anyway!) so they are able to easily try everything on over their clothing (still weird).\n\nAs annoyed as I was about the fitting room situation, I will probably make a trip out there again in the future to browse based solely on the size of the store. I just might have to wear some spandex.', positive, 5, 2
'I can\'t believe I\'ve been here multiple times and haven\'t reviewed it yet.  I absolutely love this place.  It\'s a super thrift store if you will.\n\nNo matter when I come here, I always find something.  It quite the experience.  I always make sure it\'s a day when I am off of work because I can literally spend hours here just looking.  It\'s a good thing that I do this, you can\'t just show up here and think that you will be able to gran an item and then leave.  \n\nLike a fellow reviewer said, there are not fitting rooms here, so be prepared to walk into someone trying on a potential great new garment for them self in the middle of an aisle.  Sometimes you just can\'t avoid this, I blame the fact that they have mirrors set up throughout stores.\n\nThey have everything you can seem to desire here.  Clothing to electronics, furniture to bedding, books to movies.  EVERYTHING is under this roof.\n\n*Cash only, ATM on premise.', positive, 3, 2
'I have never been treated so terrible in my whole life. Here\'s my rant, a friend and I stopped in one day after high school. I was a senior at a catholic private school at the time so I was required to wear a fancy uniform so I looked highly presentable. I picked a shirt up I was thinking of getting and held it as we browsed through the store. They announced they were closing and I was across the store from where I got the shirt. Deciding not to get it, I placed it on a near by shelf. My friend checked out, and as we were walking out of the store a  woman that worked there said to me \"where is the shirt you were holding\". I told her I had placed it on the self in the back, and said sorry for not putting it back. She said \" I walked back there and didn\'t see it, so where is it\" and clearly implied that i stole it.  I told her again that it was on the shelf as nice as I could and she then told me that she didn\'t believe me and told me to go back there and get it or else she was going to search me. Now I get that it doesn\'t matter that the shirt was 50 cents because stealing is still wrong but because I didn\'t steal it and told her so I feel Im justified in being furious that I was publicly humiliated and falsely accused over 50 cents. I walked to the back of the store picked it up and started walking back and then the lady said in a grossly rude tone \" well I didn\'t see it back there\" no apology, no nothing. I handed it to her and walked out. I\'ve never been there since. I was so angry I forgot to get her name tag so I could complain to the manager. I have never been treated so badly by anyone let alone a complete stranger and store clerk. I don\'t shop at stores that hire such terrible staff.', negative, 1, 0

'Hooray for the Red, White & Blue!  There are some great bargains here, especially if you shop their sale items.  Make sure you look at their sign as you enter to determine which color tags are on sale.  Also, Wednesday is Senior Citizens Appreciation Day (55 years of age and \nolder), so look for additional savings on Wednesdays if you qualify.\n\nThis store was remodeled several years ago, and at that time they especially improved and expanded the parking lot.\n\nIf you dig through their large inventory, you will always find a bargain.  Come back in a couple of weeks, their inventory changes quickly.  Clothes are arranged by Men/Women/Children, color, and size, so that helps your search.  \n\nUh oh, no fitting rooms, which can be a draw back, but the prices are pretty good...so it\'s worth the risk.  Check items closely for holes and flaws.\n\nThey have an annoying recorded announcement about what happens when tags are removed, but other than that, the store is pretty pleasant and well lit.\n\nCash only.', positive, 4, 3

'This is one of the true sleepers of \"neighborhood Pittsburgh.\" Since 1979, this \"diner/family restaurant\" has been serving excellent breakfasts and home-cooked dinners. The staff has been there as long.\n\nThey have some of the best fresh-brewed iced tea in the city. They also have my favorite pancakes. If you\'re looking for a cheap, low key, dependable place to go, come home at 8 o\'clock one evening, sit in the window, and especially around the holiday season, I assure you that it will be one of the best \"old time\" meals you\'ll ever have. \n\nI hate its name, but I love the Rusty Nail.', positive, 2, 0
'The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful, prices are reasonable, the wait staff are gems, and is often bragged about by Bellevue locals.  That said, two stars is all I can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  I\'ve witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I\'m not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn\'t) .  Yes, the tables are packed THAT close together.

They should really look at expanding the restaurant.', positive, 1, 0
'I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn\'t return for seconds.', negative, 1, 0
'Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I\'m sad to say I was sorely disappointed. \n\nThey have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that\'s right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  \n\nWe were here on a weekday morning so we didn\'t have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.  And it\'s not that I thought anything was bad, it\'s just that, as the two star rating says, \"Meh, I\'ve experienced better.\"  Given the plethora of choices in Bellevue, this will not be my first stop should I find myself on Lincoln Avenue for breakfast again.', negative, 0, 0

When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I\'m not one to send back food, and that\'s my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way.

'I ate here this past Sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.\n\nFor my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.', positive, 1, 1

'The first time we went here assuming by the name that it must be a dive bar. We were disappointed, but we were also hungry so we ordered dinner. It was just nothing special pretty typical greasy diner food.

So, sometime later, on a hungover morning after a wedding some of my boyfriends friends were staying with me and wanted to get some breakfast and I thought let\'s check out that rusty nail again. What a great decision. I think we all got one of the specials and they were all delicious. Mine came with some kind of homemade hash brown patties that were amazing. The only downside is they only take cash (that\'s not uncommon around here) but they have an atm. Also there is often a wait on the weekends but for us it wasn\'t very long and they have free coffee outside for you while you wait. Well ok one more thing the actual restaurant is very small and kinda lop-sided but hey I\'d rather have a cheap delicious breakfast in a shitty place than pay more for a nicer atmosphere.', positive, 2, 0
'On our recent visit to Pittsburgh my family and I had breakfast at the Rusty Nail in Bellevue (dad\'s hometown).  The place is on the main street, Lincoln Ave (or up street as my family called it).\n\nThey were quite busy on a Saturday morning but we only waited about 5-10 minutes for a table.  I enjoyed a sausage omelet with American cheese and my husband had a Denver omelet.  The omelets were well prepared and served with toast.  Potatoes were and extra $2.29, but a serving of potatoes was enough for two.  Breakfast for four adults was about $50 including tip.  All adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfast.\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt on the day we were there and coffee refills were offered readily.  It is cramped quarters, but typical for neighborhood non-diner breakfast joints in urban areas.\n\nWe had a great diner breakfast in homey surroundings.

'Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations.

'The food at Joe\'s Rusty nail is GREAT. As the pictures will show, the servings/portions are plentiful. The service is quick, and the staff personable. I went there for breakfast AND everyone in our group left sated!! As always I had my kid carnivores in tow, and as is their custom they laid waste to EVERYTHING edible that was put before them. While they are a TAD (and I do mean tad)  bit pricey I believe that the food is more than worth it. The clientele (what I can only believe are Bellevue regulars) are polite and inviting. My breakfast was made well, tasted great, and dressed pretty as a picture. I will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last.

'Wanted to try this neighborhood brunch spot and popped in this weekend. It\'s cash only and seat yourself so don\'t just stand there when you walk in like we did. There\'s no hostess station so pick a table and sit down. Blend! We sat down next to an elderly gentleman reading the newspaper in his Steelers\' Starters jacket. That\'s the type of brunch place this is.\n\nPrices are very reasonable: basic breakfasts (eggs, pancakes, omlettes) weren\'t over $6.95 and even the specials were only $8 or $9.\n\nI got the eggs benedict which is my go-to, however I didn\'t care for this version. Instead of hollandaise sauce, the dish comes with CHEESE sauce. Not my favorite that it came on a thin English muffin either, but our potatoes were good. (Two options: deep fried and pan fried with onions. We got both and thought the deep fried were best. Can you blame us?!)\n\nTotal bill for 2 came to $20.

'This is by far, the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The \"flavor of the week\" is always interesting-and tasty! Though, I am somewhat disappointed that they\'ve switched to a lower grade ice milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings. I don\'t know if this is a matter of cutting corners, or if the better stuff simply isn\'t available any longer. Either way, this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of DQ, Tastee Freeze, etc. It\'s definitely worth the trip. It\'s mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big, they can\'t fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.\n\nIf you want a real \"Kodak moment\"-order a large cone for the kids, and keep the camera, and wet wipes handy!', positive, 1, 0
'I didn\'t know what to expect when I came here thinking this was an actual ice cream shop where it is actually an ice cream stand.\n\nThere are signs posted on the wall telling you not to use your cellphone when you are ordering, They accept credit cards not debit with a minimal $10.00 purchase. That is never a problem for me since my banking cards have both options attached to them. They also won\'t service you if you are in line straddling a bike.\n\nThe size of the cones they serve are reminiscent of Isaly\'s. Prices are reasonable for the quantity you get. Believe me when I say unless you are very hungry order a small. It is huge!\n\nin addition to soft serve cones and cups they also offer hard ice cream in various flavors. I got to chat with the owner Mary who makes these flavors up herself and adds her own special touch to them. Yes, you can sample them. Since I prefer hard ice cream I settled for two scoops of Black Forest ice cream complete with cherries. She offered me a lid and explained the things the business does.\n\nIn addition to selling ice cream and the usual flare every Fri and Sun evenings when it is nice they have a DeeJay come out and play music from the 50s. Once a month they have a special event. Recently they had a group of students from CMU come out and teach people how to line dance. They have a car cruise in the works. More information she told me can be found either on their website or Facebook page.\n\nMy ice cream was very good and quite filling! There are a couple of picnic tables you can sit at if you wish. There isn\'t very much parking in the area. They also have a rewards card. You must spend a minimum of $3.00 to get a hole punch and then after 10 punches you get $1.00 off your purchase.  They also have ice cream for purchase if you want a quart, half gallon, etc. Costs a bit more than the grocery stores but hey if it\'s good then it\'s worth the money to me.\n\nThis place is close to home so I definitely plan to return to check out more of the offerings. Next time I may bend and try a soft cone dipped in chocolate. So much to choose from. Definitely 4 1/2 stars in my book.', positive, 5, 4
'If I could give Dr. Murphy less than 1 star, I absolutely would.  I was a big fan of his for several years.  He is a very personable guy.  I consistently went to my 6 month cleanings, and each time he would assure me that my teeth were perfect.  At my last visit, he identified a cavity in one of my molars.  Because of its placement, it was a LARGE filling.  Ever since having the tooth filled, it consistently traps huge amounts of food and it is incredibly hard to floss because of the size of the filling.  I recently moved across the country and had to find a new dentist.  WOW--I was in for the shock of my life.  Not only do I have to have 4 of my fillings replaced, but the one that Murphy did most recently has an obscene overhang that presses into an adjacent tooth.  The new dentist was shocked at the quality of work.  He also asked me if my previous dentist ever recommended that I see an orthodontist about my tilted lower molars.  I said absolutely not, I was told that there\'s nothing they could do about them aside from extracting the teeth and replacing them with implants.  The new dentist couldn\'t believe that!  He said that would be incredibly drastic and unreasonable and that the molars could very likely be corrected with some brackets.  It upsets me that Dr. Murphy would have allowed me to have unnecessary and costly dental work, and that his preventive care was so sub-par.  I am suffering the consequences of trusting an individual who is either ignorant, apathetic, or both.  Do not go here--find another dentist.', negative, 1, 0
'I have been a patient at Murphy\'s Family Dentistry since February of this year and I couldn\'t be more pleased with the level of service. I am afraid of drills/pain etc. and going to the dentist like most of America gives me a little bit of anxiety.  Some dentist offices that I have been too have made me feel silly if I had a shred of anxiety and were a bit insensitive.    When I compare those to this dentistry there is no comparison. There\'s a level of comfort and its obvious & appreciated. \n\nI just recently had a root canal/crown placement.   I had a very bad experience years ago and was very weary about the whole process.  This Dentistry was a dream and really was great throughout the entire process.   I am most comfortable and most important - in and out..  there is never a wait and I know exactly what to expect.   I recommend 100\%', positive, 1, 1

'My second stop on my quest to explore beer distributors in my neighborhood, and the best of the two!\n\nYou won\'t find super obscure beers here in general, and I didn\'t look for Belgians, but they had plenty of IPAs for me to choose from.  Ithaca Flower Power, Loose Canon, Lagunitas IPA, Full Pint Chinookie and TriPA, and more.  I believe I even saw some Green Flash.  However, I went with a case of Lagunitas Sucks!, not an IPA per-se, but a beer that\'s been hard to find anywhere and has a 98 \"world class\" score on Beer Advocate.  It set me back $40 ($42.79 with tax).\n\nMy trip was complete with the neighborhood smelly drunk asking me where the $10 case on sale was, the college dude looking for the same thing, and another man apologizing for accidentally complaining about bedroom issues with the gf within my hearing.  I considered all of this a plus.  Great atmosphere, and the staff was friendly too, though I only needed help in wanting less beer.\n\nI\'ll probably be back for some Flower Power in a week or two.\n\nI also experienced the joke that no one knows how to park in their parking lot - heck, I was probably one of those people.

'We are fans of Pistella Beer Distributors simply because we needed beer one night while visiting some friends and family in Pittsburgh and they happened to be on the way to something we were doing.  It\'s a hole in the wall kind of facade but they do have a good selection.  I don\'t remember the price being that expensive but looking at the average review so far...it shows $$$$.  I\'m sure they have some nice stuff, but we just got a case of beer (I think one of those Magic Hat variety packs) and it seemed similar to what we would pay in the other stores.  Anyway, we had a good experience with this place and don\'t really have anything bad to say about them.', positive, 0, 0

'Not a fan. I\'ve been here twice in the past six months and both times the person working was rude and unfriendly. It might have been the same worker both times.

We were not acknowledged at all and we waited some more. We finally had to ask if we could pay for our beer. He looked up from what he was doing and said \"Ummm, yeahhh\" then finally came over, no apology, no greeting. As soon as we paid he slid the glass door closed again. No \"thank you\" or \"have a good day\". There were still two hours before they closed, so it\'s not like we came when they were trying to close. We left wondering what just happened. It was a weird experience. I\'ll continue to look for a different distributor, which sucks because it\'s so close to me, but I\'d rather spend my money somewhere else.

'I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino\'s a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \"Italian frites.\"  The latter, which the menu described as \"fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN\' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!\n\nAs a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.

'Pino\'s appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it\'s literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable.

Unfortunately, the only other reason you\'d be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street.

'What a disappointment!! Evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  \nWe had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what \"awhile\" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).\n\nFood was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.\n\nService was rough.

This was our \"go-to\" restaurant.\n\nAFTER Pino\'s was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It\'s no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren\'t even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d\', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu\'s at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.\n\nThe food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business.

The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really?

We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \n\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \n\nOverall, embarrassing.

Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? \n\nTo make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check.

Sent my car back and they said another 500$ to replace several sensors will fix the problems, which is non-sense. I will never trust them anymore and nether should you.

'This Giant Eagle truly is giant!  And believe me, that\'s about all it has going for it!  You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\n\nYou know that a trip to a large, \"one size fits all\" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy\'s or Boscov\'s.  You know that it\'s pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  Its purpose is purely utilitarian.  But good gravy, you\'d think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  It shouldn\'t take you a half-hour just to get one item.  \n\nThat\'s what happened to me yesterday.  I would have been better off going to Cogo\'s or 7-11.  I might have paid a bit more, but I would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  I prefer the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill.', negative, 0, 0
'I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I\'ve seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\n\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \n\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you\'ll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don\'t miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You\'re not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn\'t that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed \"the dirty bird.\"  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.', negative, 0, 1
'I cannot in my life understand why this Giant Eagle, of all the Giant Eagles, would get a five star rating.  From the moment you walk into here it\'s like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you\'re in there.\n\nThe set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn\'t have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It\'s like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it\'s too late to turn around because it\'s the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you\'ve been walking forever.  \n\nHonestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn\'t want to venture any further to complete my shopping.', negative, 1, 1
'I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It\'s just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce.

'As a petite, young, white female, I\'m fearful to go here alone. I choose this giant eagle (most of the time) over the big Market District one on Center avenue because it\'s easier to find a place to park, and you can run in and grab what you need quickly. However, I feel like I walk around with my purse clutched tightly to my side and have to watch my back. The clientele that hang out/shop here is not the greatest. There is a police officer that sits at the front of the building, which is good, that makes me feel a bit better. Most cashiers are friendly and nice. Some are very slow. The shift supervisor that hangs out around the cash registers is extremely unfriendly and often shows little disregard for her job, her employees, and customers. More than once she has yelled at me to \"move faster\" when using the self checkout, and when my self checkout lane has needed the assistance of an employee because it wasn\'t working, she makes sure you know you\'ve bothered her from what she was doing.

'Avoid. Employees are unhelpful and rude. Went in this AM to try to find my wife some flowers for her birthday, stopped to ask employee who was restocking shelves if they carried flowers. The employee looked at me, ignored me, and continued stocking the shelves. This interaction is fairly representative of all the encounters I\'ve had in this store. Employees are rude, unhelpful and frequently give a lot of attitude if asked to do anything for a customer. Shoppers are slow, obnoxious, and frequently hold up lines arguing with cashiers about the prices of items. I\'ve seen several families get into loud screaming matches in the middle of the store over what to buy for groceries.Cashiers don\'t help the matter, as they scan and bag items as slowly as they possibly can, and make what should be a five minute trip into a twenty minute ordeal. This is also the only giant eagle I\'ve ever been to that doesn\'t sell beer. The liquor store around the corner employs equally rude individuals and has a very heavy police presence, probably to prevent shoplifting.

Right!

My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I\'d called ahead.

Nope! She called him over and I said \"sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I\'d be next in line\" and the lady said \"oh we don\'t do that.\" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this?

The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said \"after I\'m done here,\" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving.

Again, no herbs and spices. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti. The only way I can describe the sauce is: Think of diluted Ragu. My pasta was also overcooked and there was no flavor whatsoever so I had to put so much parmesan cheese. I couldn\'t even taste garlic in it. What kind of Italian food has no garlic? The baked ziti was overcooked and dry, and it was tasteless according to my fiance. \n\nService was slow, but there was only one waitress in the restaurant.

Since this was the Geico rep telling me this I couldn\'t really argue, but I don\'t know why Geico keeps working with a business that repeatedly does this to its customers.\n\nI got the car back in great condition, cleaned on the outside, and the console wiped down inside.  All in all, just alright - go here if you\'re not pressed for time and you\'ve got Geico, otherwise shop around.', negative, 1, 0
'Horrible experience. I was rear ended at a stop sign, wasn\'t my fault. Mikes did the repairs, poorly. Trunk lines off, bumper lines off, wires for taillights hanging, rear header panel was pushed in from the accident. Taillights pushed out after accident. Mikes didn\'t repair any of these issues. Even after I had told them during the estimate. Also found chips dumped out on the passenger side floor. They are truly an express shop. I wouldn\'t recommend them to anyone.', negative, 1, 0
'We were in an accident and our insurance recommended we go to Mike\'s. We dropped off the car a few days before Christmas, understanding that the holiday would mean there would be a delay. We didn\'t get the car back from them for about a month after that (the damage was not *that* extensive. It was basically a fender bender). Communication was horrible; we had to call them, they wouldn\'t call us. After three weeks, we called and they promised it would be done on a certain day. We called the day before to confirm that the car was ready and were told that they forgot to order a part and it would be two more days. Called two days later to confirm it was ready. \"No, it\'s not ready yet. We\'ll call you when it is.\" Days passed and no call. Finally called them again and they said \"Yeah, your car was ready yesterday.\" Are we supposed to be psychic?\n\nWe picked up the car and before even getting it home, the \"check engine\" light came on. We took it back to Mike\'s and they said they just needed to reset the computer. They did so and the light went off. Left and halfway home, \"check engine\" light came back on. We took it to another mechanic and found out that Mike\'s missed quite a few things, resulting in several hundred dollars in additional repairs. Now we have to submit all kinds of paperwork to the insurance company to add a supplement to the original insurance claim. Not fun!', negative, 1, 0
'Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate\'s name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn\'t), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I\'m guessing this was since I wasn\'t the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn\'t return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten\'s health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where\'s the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn\'t eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That\'s what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can\'t breathe and who won\'t eat because he\'s too congested to smell his food.  It\'s very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo\' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!', negative, 8, 1
'Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \"Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \"Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \"I\'ll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\" We said no, that\'s okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \"Would you like a moment before I take him?\" No \"I\'m sorry.\" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service.

'I\'m conflicted as to how to proceed with this review.  I think this place is a necessity for the city, and their open-door policy ensures no one will be turned away, saving thousands of animals, but their staff members are some of the most unprofessional and RUDE people I\'ve ever met. When they say that no animal will be euthanized unless it has a health or behavior issue, believe that \'behavior\' is a very broad term.  In their own words,  \"Any animal that doesn\'t tolerate, and also welcome, handling by strangers will be euthanized\".  I found this out when I fostered 5 kittens, and all of the 7 week old kittens were to be put down because they were \'fussy\'.  What the hell kitten isn\'t fussy?!!!! They\'re curious little guys that want down to explore! \n When I took the kittens in to offer up for adoption, the exam room was right next to a room full of barking and howling dogs.  There was a girl back there howling at the top of her lungs and laughing, I guess she thought it was funny that the dogs were so terrified and distressed?  The tech handled the kittens (that were terrified because of all the noise) very roughly, and shoved them back into the crate, injuring one of them.  When one of the kittens tried to stop herself from being shoved in the crate, it scratched her, and she became very angry, telling me they would all be euthanized for acting this way!  Luckily, the volunteers must have handled them and helped to calm them, because they were able to offer 2 them up for adoption.  If it wasn\'t for the volunteers, that place would be a hellhole for all those poor babies.\n.\nWhen I took one of the kittens that I ended up adopting (to save them from certain death) to be spayed, the extremely rude tech handed her to me in a box to take home.  After an hour and a half drive home, I opened the box to find my kitten wrapped so tightly in a towel she couldn\'t move, and she had another towel around her face so tight she couldn\'t breathe!  I was never so angry in my life!  I don\'t care how rude you are to me, but do not take it out on the animals!  The poor baby probably hissed or scratched at the tech, so the tech decided to protect herself from the vicious 2 pound kitten by immobilizing her.  \n\nI am now fostering 2 kittens from them that are very sick.  They told me they do better getting well in a home,  Well no doubt, when I got them home, they were FILTHY,  with feces all over their backside, and they weigh less than they did 2 weeks ago when I took them there.  when I asked the \'vet tech\' what kind of food they fed them, she said, \'Oh it doesn\'t matter\'.  It most definitely does matter!  Suddenly changing an animals food causes gastic distress, vomiting and diarrhea.  Even the cheapest bag of pet food will tell you that.  That\'s probably how they got so sick!  I\'m actually afraid to complain to anyone until the cats I fostered are adopted, I\'m terrified they will hurt the kittens!\n\nI hate to say, \"Don\'t go here, don\'t take your animals here\", because then only the animals suffer!  But if you have a bad experience, get names, and write the managers and CEO, and let them know specifics.  Hopefully getting the wrong people out of there.

Just because it\'s cheap doesn\'t mean it\'s worth it. Please reconsider their clinic, but continue to adopt and visit them as the staff was somewhat friendly...

'First of all, the alterations themselves were well done. Had to get two coats taken in with recent weight loss, and he did a great job with that aspect. So I have no gripe with the tailoring itself.\n\nHowever...\n\n1. To take in one full suit and one blazer, he charged $345!!! I understand that it was a decent amount of work, but I\'ve never in my life paid that much for alterations. I have also been told by two other professionals in the clothing industry that he\'s the most expensive guy in town. So beware, you are paying to dollar! I was in a time crunch, so paid anyways.\n\n2. My suit coat came back ruined! Once again, honest story here. I almost always keep a pack of gum in my inner chest pocket, something I have done for years. I hadn\'t worn this suit for some time (hence the need to alter), and apparently there was a pack in this one. When I got the suit home to try on, I immediately noticed the whole liner on that side of the jacket was starchy and stiff, and I had never noticed this before. At that point, I hadn\'t put two and two together yet. I thought maybe they had melted the silk liner during dry cleaning or something. So I went back first thing the next day, and showed the tailor. I figured liability was just on them for botching the cleaning, so all I wanted was for it to be fixed. His ony response was \"you never noticed before? It came in like that.\" I had never felt it in my life, but didnt have any other response so just left. Once I started thinking about it again, I had felt the gum when trying on at home before I took it in the first time. So it most definitely happened during the dry cleaning process, as was confirmed by the new cleaner to whom I was referred to fix. If he would have owned up and apologized, it\'s not even a matter of money to me, but more of honesty. Really bitter taste after the experience, and unfortunately doesn\'t make me comfortable returning, despite the alterations themselves being great.', negative, 0, 0
'I go to this CVS all the time, since I work in the neighborhood.  I\'m not a huge fan of it - I go mostly due to convenience.

Also, a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock.  Like, razor blades.  And body wash.  BODY WASH?

'Never again. Let me repeat, never again. \n\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \"guilty-until-proven guilty\" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you\'d get greeted when you approach the counter, and you\'d get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \"maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\"  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \"adventures\" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won\'t cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it\'s too much to ask to TELL someone you\'re speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren\'t any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \"found\" my wife\'s prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.

Our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive.  \n\nI would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  For $10 I would certainly get my money\'s worth, and the quality of the food was OK.\n\nSurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.  A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.', negative, 2, 1
'I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV\'s.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa\'s Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.', negative, 1, 0
'My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty \"meh\" experience for me.  We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn\'t even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It\'s nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\n\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren\'t too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn\'t hot, first of all - I\'d say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn\'t taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn\'t a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that\'s what I get for trying to order healthy here.  \n\nI just wasn\'t much interested in it, and I don\'t think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I\'m paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don\'t have a huge appetite, so that wasn\'t a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.\n\nNot particularly interested in returning for any reason.', negative, 0, 0
'Superbowl Sunday at the Blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the \" who really cares about this game\"  show. I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. \n\nThe food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was \"EH\". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn\'t like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn\'t go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside. Madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here I most likely won\'t be back.', negative, 3, 1
'When Hotlick\'s died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\n\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it\'s about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don\'t want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \n\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \"space\" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT\'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick\'s Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick\'s Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn\'t really try) to keep them in the so called \"party room\" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn\'t hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\n\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT\'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\n\nThe \"wonderful\" Staff: It seems like it\'s everyone\'s first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \"Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\" (oh she\'s twisting her finger in her hair while she\'s talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can\'t remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they\'re idiots so no worries).\n\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you\'ll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don\'t claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\n\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they\'re everywhere!!!!!', negative, 1, 0
'Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be good. Something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad.

'This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can\'t give zero stars, I\'m giving the service one. We didn\'t eat anything so I can\'t comment on the food. \n\nMy husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn\'t find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that\'s what we were supposed to do.\n\nThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn\'t. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn\'t be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\n\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn\'t get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\n\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That\'s over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back.', negative, 0, 0
'I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \n\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don\'t get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn\'t think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won\'t go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.', negative, 1, 0

'I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  \n\nI love it because it\'s extremely close to me (so, it\'s convenient when I\'m craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I\'m a giant Steeler fan, but you\'ll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  \n\nHowever, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn\'t rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don\'t.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it\'s not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don\'t want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it\'s not worth much of a visit.', negative, 0, 0
'To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It\'s the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all.', negative, 0, 0
'Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar.

'I\'ve been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour, and met my daughter there last night for Happy Hour specials as advertised on the web site.  First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter\'s choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else\'s food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn\'t want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn\'t necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.

'My experience was similar to Amy R. Midas installed a tie rod INCORRECTLY. I of course didn\'t notice (who looks at their tie rod after having one installed). When I had my state inspection done, my neighborhood mechanic found the problem and fixed it (which I had to pay for). I complained to Midas and they said that I should have had the neighborhood mechanic put my car back together and then drive the car to Midas to re-install the tie rod properly. Since I would have had to pay my mechanic labor anyway, and Midas had already shown that they didn\'t know how to properly install tie rods, this option made no sense to me. My car is working fine now (thanks to my neighborhood mechanic) but it was like pulling teeth to get any money back from Midas. It was only after I complained to the PA Attorney General that they refunded the money I paid them for the faulty tie rod installation. Like Amy R., they offered to give me a free service (I think it may have been an alignment). But my safety is important to me so I\'m never letting them touch my car again. The Attorney General tried to get Midas to give me the money I had to pay my neighborhood mechanic (which I wouldn\'t have had to pay but for their ineptitude).

The AG did, however, suggest that I file a civil claim with the magistrate and thought I had a good case.

That worked out perfect bc i work 9-5 and an actual appt before 6pm wouldnt be possible. Plus, our car is at 108k and needed high milage oil. So we drop off the car.... no envelopes or pens to write down information. luckily i found an envelope in our car and borrowed a pen from advanced auto across the street. \n\nSo the next day we go to get the car. I asked if high milage oil was used. He said no because we didnt discuss it. (really?! -_-) I asked if they did the tire rotation. He said it wasnt needed.... Midas is known for complimentary tire rotations w/ an oil change so just do it instead of making BS excuses. I asked how the courtesy check went and he said everything came back ok which was also a lie bc we were told at our last oil change that the air filter will need replaced soon  and a week later the check engine light came on... so clearly the courtesy check wasnt done bc everything wasnt ok.  WHYYYYY do things half-asked? \n\nFinally we go to leave and i realize the sticker inside the windshield wasnt updated for the oil change (!!!!!!!!!!!)  We had to go back in and ask to get one printed. Seriously how to you mess up a simple oil change appt in multiple ways. \n\nToo many mechanics in east end. I\'ll go elsewhere if a quick-fix problem occurs. For scheduled maintenance, i\'ll stick with the Midas in Monroeville- they were helpful, honest & did everything the right way.', negative, 4, 2
'Crooks. Brought my car for tire rotation&oil change, we specifically discussed that my oil change will be $19.99. Got a call from them later trying to sell me alignment, brake jobs, more expensive oil ($55 !!) - the usual crap they sell to people because they think they are idiots. Refused all of those. Came to pick up my car after work and waited for 1 hr 20 min, was last one at the shop. Saw that my car is out and saw the chart brought to the frontdesk a while ago, but the frontdesk guy didn\'t give it to me for good half hour for no apparent reason. When I asked what\'s up he finally processed my car and it turned out that he put in the most expensive oil in the shop. \n\nDude, do you really think I can\'t see you did it on purpose? You couldn\'t convince me to buy any extras so you thought you\'ll sneak this in and I won\'t notice. Then when I noticed, you tried to bullshit me that this is the only option for my car.\n\nCheaters should go out of business. I hope you do.', negative, 0, 0

'If you are in the market for a 6 hour oil change I have found the place for you. \n\nSo this will be my first ever review online. I brought my truck in for a flat tire yesterday and an oil change. I dropped the truck off at 12:36 PM and was told it would take 2-3 hours. So I left the truck there. At 4:30PM I returned after work thinking it must be complete since it was 4 hrs later. At 5:00PM the front desk guy asked me if I was also in need a of an oil change (which I found shocking considering it was what I brought in for and was not even started yet.) 5:15PM I ask how much longer it was going to take. The front desk clerk said that it should not be much longer. I respond that it was to be completed almost 2 hours prior. He stated that that they were busy. Then he knew how busy they were when I dropped the truck off. So why was I not told an truthful time of how long it would actually take, so that I could decide if I wanted drop it off or not? At 5:30 he asked me what if I just wanted the tire in the bed of my truck. I responded that I wanted the tire put back under the truck. For some reason they translated that I wanted the spare tire on the truck and put the chrome tire back under my truck. At this point I\'m starting to look for the hidden camera, thinking it has to be some sort of joke. Even when I told the clerk that that I had to pick up my daughter after school at 6 they seemed to move even slower. At one put I could see 3 of them gathered around a cell phone. 6:15 PM my truck is finally done. Was charged for full synthetic oil (even though i never asked for it). \n\nSo in conclusion:\n\nDoes not value the time of the customers\nLong drawn out service w/ no sense of urgency\nBunch of clown. Don\'t waste your time, go some place were they care about getting your car work completed in a timely fashion.', negative, 0, 0
'I have lived in a townhouse that Motheral owns for the past year and a half or so. Linda (the property manager who just retired - thank GOD) is the worst! At first she was nice to us and was prompt with repairs and getting back to us - but towards the end of our lease she became extremely difficult to work with and wouldn\'t stop bothering us even after she had retired. Honestly she needs to get a life and stop bothering the tenants who are no longer her responsibility!! The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the new property manager seems incredibly nice and I don\'t want to totally deter everyone just because of Linda who was a bad seed.

I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\nOne irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \"we don\'t have those anymore\" or \"no, we can\'t cook wings dry.\" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.', negative, 0, 0

'When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn\'t really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I\'ve heard about this place.', negative, 0, 0
'I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\n\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don\'t have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \"personal\" pie, costs $7 and is 7\" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that\'s a very small amount of pizza, and since I\'m hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \"small,\" which is 10\". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they\'d also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \"I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \"well this isn\'t the best pizza I\'ve ever had but it\'s fine.\" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma\'s pizza. I thought, \"it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I\'ll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\"\n\nI ate three out of the six \"slices.\" (One sixth of a 10\" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn\'t stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don\'t like, and expired foods, because I don\'t want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It\'s still in my mouth. I\'m not making this up.\n\nI know there\'s good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price!

How utterly disgusted I was with it. \n\nFor your sensitivities, I\'ll be less graphic this time around, okay kiddo?\n\nI spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza. My gut was a mess and calling a spade a spade, the pizza is overpriced for the quality or lack of quality, that is.\n\nThe hoagie was no better.

'I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.

(I guess I\'m not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn\'t put their cart back.  \n\nSo I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don\'t even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe\'s or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don\'t need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy \"fresh\" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  \n\nRegardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I\'d rather go to the farmer\'s market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my \"whole food\".

My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.\n\nSecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.

The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\n\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \"workers\" slack before.

It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at.

Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn\'t leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\n\nAnd that\'s it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don\'t live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I\'m going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\n\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe\'s/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience.', negative, 3, 0
'I\'ll be honest, I just don\'t get it.  When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc.  If it\'s edible and it\'s within my palate\'s liking range then I eat it.\n\nFrom that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.  So it feels like 90\% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium.\n\nTheir prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven.

'I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there\'s the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it\'s inherent in the scheme of selling premium \"natural\" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing.

'This is a cut and paste from a review I wrote on apartmentratings.  \n\nI read the poor reviews for Kamin, but decided to reserve my judgement of their places until I saw for myself. I must say that after my experience today, I\'m thinking that the reviews here are far from hyperbolic. \n\nI was scheduled to see two units today - one on Walnut and one on S. Negley. When my boyfriend and I arrived at the first place, the building manager, Paul informed us that we could just look at the unit on Walnut Street because, \"They are identical apartments...Same builder and everything, but if you want to fight against traffic this time of day, we can.\" First of all Paul, the floor plan may be the same, but no two units are alike. The kitchen may have been updated in one or maybe the bathroom tile was different, the building may smell different and maybe a potential tenant wants to see the view out the window. Secondly, if we\'re going to potentially sign a lease to pay almost $1,400 per month, we\'d at least like to see the actual unit we\'d be living in. In addition to that, the other apartment was only three blocks from this building. We felt that the 8 minute walk would not be that terrible of an inconvenience (for us anyway, but then again Paul seemed to be in a hurry.) \n\nAnyway, we got to the first place and Paul let us in. Rather than engage us or talk to us about the apartment, he just stood there in the living room with his arms crossed and left us to wander through the apartment on our own. He didn\'t offer any information and answered our questions with one or two word answers. Seriously, if he\'s that rude now, what\'s he going to be like when the lease gets signed? Strike one.\n \nAfter we left the building on Walnut, the boyfriend and I walked down to S. Negley and met Paul there. He let us in and led us upstairs where he actually let a door slam right in my face. What a nice guy! And so gentlemanly! Strike Two. When we got to the second apartment, we were wandering around when I noticed a gigantic water mark with bubbling paint and all in the corner of the ceiling in one of the bedrooms with a lovely black stain that I can only assume is mold. The current tenant informed me that the roof leaked. Noooooow I know why Paul didn\'t want us looking at the second unit! Strike three. Kamin\'s out. We just turned around and walked out at that point. \n\n\nI do have to say though that Paul did us a favor by being so incredibly rude, unprofessional and overall kind of a tool. Heck maybe he hates working for Kamin and this is his way of \"sticking it to the man.\" If it weren\'t for him, we may have believed whatever BS story a *good* salesman would have given us about how they\'re fixing the roof or whatnot and we may have actually bought the story and been miserable for a year. How lucky for us that Kamin has such a \"pleasant\" guy dealing with the public. It\'s sad though because overall the apartments would be very desirable if it weren\'t for Paul and the obviously leaking roof.

'I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery...\n\nI made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don\'t expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I\'ve had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else\'s job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, \"the host is supposed to do that but I will...\" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. \n\nI was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store.

You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. \n\nCasbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.\n\n**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!', negative, 2, 0
'For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito\'s crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can\'t miss option...well, sometimes things don\'t turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow\'s milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn\'t be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I\'ll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we\'d not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \"right out.\"  While I guess she didn\'t define \"right out,\" what this actually meant was \"in 25 minutes.\"  Starting first with my mother\'s combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory mélange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother\'s plate would be my sister\'s option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I\'m still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \"Mac and Cheese\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \"just the bill.\"\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I\'ve encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don\'t\' normally happen like that and he\'d be sure the issue was addressed.

'For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \"yes, it\'s got lemon in it.\" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \"yes, it\'s a lemon and fig drink.\" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks.

With plenty of time to review the night\'s menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef\'s feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order.  \nM', negative, 0, 0

'Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn\'t packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we\'d prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. \n\nI immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. \n\nI started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. \n\nFor the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.\n\nFor the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.\n\nThe cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. \n\nLastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. \n\nService was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. \n\nThis place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn\'t go back for that price.', negative, 1, 0
'While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.  \n\nWhen my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn\'t going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\n\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \n\nI\'m not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don\'t think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \n\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!', negative, 1, 1
'Three strikes and you\'re out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?', negative, 0, 0
'I had my first experience with Casbah on a recent Friday night in a group of 4 without a reservation arriving around 9pm. Here is a summary of our experience: \n\nPROS: \n- Ambiance is nice, upscale, not too loud. \n- We were able to find a low table in the bar within 15 minutes. \n- Drinks were good, generously proportioned. Cocktails were priced as expected for the type of place ($10-$14). Wine list had multiple options by the glass.\n- As for the meal, the meats were good cuts, well prepared. \n\nCONS: \n- Overall the food felt rich with creams, fats, salt without any particular inspiration showing through. The ingredients were all good and well sourced, but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way. \n- The service was high end of amateur - not what I was expecting from this caliber of restaurant. Our 30 minute wait stretched to 1hr 30min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff. Upon sitting we were told that they usually have \"excellent sourdough bread\", but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta (which was fine, but we didnt need to hear what we didn\'t get to have). \n\nFOOD: (vegetarian options reviewed directly, meat options as reported by dining companions)\n- Cheese plate: Nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses. Only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them. \n- Beet salad: the greens were good, the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets, the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked. \n- Squash soup: Overall very good - quite rich but flavorful. Felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash \n- Mushroom pasta: Again quite rich and salty. Packed with high quality mushrooms but didn\'t feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter. Pasta was high quality but again, overshadowed by the salt and butter. \n- Steak: Good cut of meat, cooked well.\n- Ragu pasta: Excellent pasta dish well cooked, reported to be almost as good as Piccolo Forno\'s. \n\nOVERALL: \nA similar experience at 2/3 the price would have received 3 stars, for the price of the meal this was barely a 2 star event. We won\'t be going back, even with the lure of 2 for 1 entrees around our birthdays - the food just isn\'t that good even discounting the service. I\'m sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd, but there are much better dinner options out there.', negative, 1, 0
'I want to start by saying that it kills me to give Casbah two stars and I wish there were two rating systems - one for the food and another one for service since my review is really about the latter. The food as always is exceptional.\n\nI have been going to Casbah for well over a decade and it is a place where my family has always celebrated special occasions because of the wonderful atmosphere, food and the great service - or what used to be great service. \n\nWe went to Casbah last night for dinner to celebrate a family birthday expecting to have a nice, memorable evening. Alas! that wasn\'t to be. Our server (Seth) and the service provided by him can be described in just one word - INDIFFERENCE. He went through the motions of taking our order and bringing us our food but that was it. We were never told of any specials. We were not brought any bread till we asked for it. We were not asked for re-fills on our drinks or even our water. We were not once asked how the food was and if we needed anything else. On ordering dessert, we were not asked if we needed coffee or drinks to go with and so on. In my book, indifference is worse than bad service.  \n\nI could have looked past it if it was just the server\'s style and lack of work ethic (every place has some of those people!) but what really highlighted this lackluster service was that the very same server was providing exceptional service to a neighboring table with a much larger party than ours. Perhaps because gratuity was automatically included? I don\'t know but suffice to say I was very disappointed and somewhat annoyed. \n\nCasbah is not your \"neighborhood\" place to drop in for dinner and the food and ambiance don\'t come cheap. So the least they can do is to make sure that service is consistent. It is relatively easy to attract new customers but really tough to sustain them.  I hope this was just a one-time occurrence but I feel like I need to highlight it in a public forum in the hope that someone from Big Burrito sees this and has it addressed. \n\nI\'m so disappointed. I hope I can go back there again. I would hate to lose this place!', negative, 1, 0
'Parking: Street parking or valet. \n\nInitial thoughts: I\'ve heard this place had great food, and since I was quite hungry, I was excited. \n\nWait time: We had a reservation, so we were seated right away. \n\nService: Great - the waiters were attentive and made sure we were enjoying our meal and had our water glasses filled. \n\nAppetizers/Small dishes: Cheese tasting with 5 cheese - it was so tiny. Not worth the price. The cheese were interesting, but for the cost I expected more than just a few small slices of bread, a few slices of cheese, and a dollop of jam. \n\nMain dish: Long Island duck - TOO SALTY. I thought the duck itself was cooked well, but as I was eating it I had to constantly drink water to make up for the taste. There were a few measly pieces of gnocchi. There was no lavender flavor or kumquats. I would recommend getting something other than this dish if you do go. \n\nDrinks: We ordered a bottle of Riesling, which was good but nothing special. \n\nCost: The main dishes were all around $30-35. For the cost, I expected the flavor to wow me, but really I just need a lot of water to drink. \n\nAmbience: We sat in the part of the restaurant that was under a tent-like structure. It was a bit chilly, but they had the heated lights on. It is dark, so don\'t expect to take any good photos. \n\nOverall: Just okay. I wish I could give it more stars, but really it was disappointing. After that unsettling duck main dish, I\'m not sure If I\'m willing to try this place again.', negative, 1, 0
'I have heard much about Casbah being one of the best eateries in the 412. I went on their pasta special and got the ricotta ravioli and the short rib ravioli. The ricotta was the second most expensive dish on that menu and we received two saggy, bland pouches of what tasted like a microwaved lunchable. The short rib was doused in a gravy-like sauce that overwhelmed any taste or subtleties that may have existed. Heavy and bland. Not generally what I go out to eat for. \n\nThe service was also extremely slow. 20 minutes to get our bread and 50 to get our appetizers.', negative, 2, 0
'Pasta fest should be called deception fest. We got an email inviting us to come to pasta fest thinking it would be regular portions at a discounted price.

You got me this time but never again.', negative, 0, 0
'This place\'s reputation as a high-end restaurant is entirely undeserved. Every single entrée my party ordered was oversalted and bland. And for the price I was expecting much, much more. If you\'re looking for quality food for $25-35 per plate, go to Meat & Potatoes.', negative, 1, 0
'We were excited to go to casbah after hearing good things from locals and having gone to mad Mex, which was truly great TexMex food. despite trying to be optimistic, we really left unimpressed. here\'s the breakdown:\ncocktails/drinks- the list was unimaginative and wife\'s cocktail was neither refreshing, not very strong. the beers offered were not great, one was flat: 3/10\ngnuti- this was somewhat tasty and rich, with well cooked chunks of lobster, however nothing I\'ll remember tomorrow: 7/10\noctopus- the list of ingredients and fact that it is a Mediterranean restaurant makes you think this would be light and fresh w a salty kick from the prosciutto. but it seemed to be cooked with the prosciutto and/or brown sugar and was overcooked, a heavy lumbering dish that not even fennel could make up for. this was a big disappointment. 2/10\nhalibut-  the fish was well cooked, but the dish was generic, not exciting nor offensive, forgettable. 4/10\nCasericcha (sp?)- this really was the standout. The scallops were cooked well and it was chock full of crab. It was very rich. Nothing about the preparation was special, and it wasnt spicy and it was green with pesto so the name red pepper is somewhat of a misnomer, but for the pure weight of fresh lump crab makes this dish 8/10, even with a pretty high price for pasta of $35.\nDessert- milk sponge cake- small and fairly dry, which again, with name \"sponge\" one would be disappointed to expect a moist cake. 3/10.\nservice- the service was fine, not amazing, seemed like waiter was a little too busy for the higher prices of food. although the ambience on porch was nice, they seemed to have a hard time regulating the temperature, with various times of sweat building on the brow, throughout the meal. 5/10\ntotal: 30/7=4.something and given the price, how good everything looked on the menu and the disappointment of anticipated greatness, I\'m rounding down. \nbig burrito is a shooting 50\% (props to mad Mex), curious to see how they do in the rubber match.', negative, 1, 1
'So, I had been wanting to try this place for some time.  I have never been disappointed by a big burrito restaurant, but I guess there\'s a first time for everything.  I ordered the softshell crab, as did three others in our party.  It was awful.  It was mushy on the inside, as though they hadn\'t taken the gills off.  I have made my own fried softshell crabs before (yes they were alive, and yes I cut their faces off), so I\'m no stranger to how they should be prepared and how they should taste.  We each only had a few bites and when we told the waiter how bad it was, he didn\'t really do anything about it.  Anyway, I\'m never going back here.  Sub par at best, go to ANY of the other big burrito restaurants.', negative, 0, 0

'My fiancé and I had dinner at 7 PM last Saturday evening and were impressed with the food but highly unlikely to come back as returning customers because of the service.  First of all when the waiter (Adam) brought our first drinks and insisted we order appetizers I told him that we were going to relax for a little while and I would flag him down when we wanted to order anything else.  He persisted to come back every other 2 minutes for about another 9-10 times until we finally ordered appetizers and within 3 minutes of us ordering our appetizer he wanted us to order dinner and I politely said we want to enjoy our appetizer until he bugged us enough about dinner that we just ordered so we could get rid of him.  I paid $140 including the tip on Saturday and between barely being able to see because we were sat on the patio directly into the sun and being rushed the experience was miserable despite how good the food tasted.. it was not enjoyable. We recently moved to Pittsburgh this month and we looked forward all week to dining with you until a waiter ruined our experience.

'Quiet Storm is, perhaps, the most expensive vegetarian diner I have ever been to, even by big city standards! Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I\'ll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.\n\nF.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce.', negative, 1, 0

'I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the \"8th Ward\" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as \"garlicky\" on the menu. Sooo wrong. \"The Butter,\" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.\n\nAt this point, I\'ve tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I\'ve had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. \n\nI wouldn\'t care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn\'t REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction.

'I\'m going to revise my review of Quiet Storm.\n\nYou may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich.

'I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What\'s not to love, right? \n\nWell, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I\'m not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \"firesticks\" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we\'d been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead.', negative, 1, 0

The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It\'s never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent, but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. \n\nI really want to like Quiet Storm, but it only merits 2 stars. Their food, service, and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. \n\nOwners, please stick to your business hours. It\'s not like you\'re open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don\'t blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  \n\nOR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to \'9am - until we feel like it.\'  This way there are no set expectations and we can\'t really begrudge you for it. \n\n...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.\n\nThanks!', negative, 1, 0

The service was good, but I guess it has to be when they have the audacity to charge $9 for a sandwich that cuts your mouth open.

I haven\'t heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \"look in the back\" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\n\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren\'t given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn\'t anything special.

'Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it\'d be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn\'t the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn\'t even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn\'t bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don\'t really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I\'ve had good vegan and vegetarian food before that\'s consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates.

In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that\'s good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?\n\nThey had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you\'ve ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I\'m looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we\'re never going to be good friends but I\'d like to think that there\'s something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that\'s at least one too many; and there\'s only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.\n\nI go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we\'re leaving the waiter, who\'s been fine the whole time, asks us where we\'re from and my girlfriend answers \"D.C.\"  The waiter replies, \"Oh, I\'m sorry about that.\"  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I\'m not personally offended, but I\'m not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone\'s clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.\n\nI was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it.  If you\'re vegan and have literally no other options... then I guess you\'re going here.  If both of those conditions aren\'t true, then go anywhere else.', negative, 4, 2

'I\'m still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I\'ve been Punk\'d.\n\nA small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \"Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \"chorizo\" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \"foods.\"\n\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \"Whoa, I can\'t believe I actually like this better than meat\"? I have! But don\'t expect that feeling here. It will be more like: \"Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?\"\n\nTwo stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso. They have some really wonderful sounding tea options that I wish I could try, but I generally avoid this place because of the food.', negative, 2, 1
'This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.\n \n1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Motörhead tank top. I am a huge Motörhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don\'t want Lemmy to be making my food.\n \n2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100\% vegan.\n \n3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\n \n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\n \nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10.

'In all fairness, I went to this place after stuffing myself at Vincent\'s Pizza Park.  Still, I know a good pizza when I see one, and this place is totally passable, but great or even good it is not.  My friend and I were given our pizza in a box although we were planning on eating on the premises.  Still, it seemed like we were not wanted and decided not to press the point.  We walked across the street to a parking lot and saw a Pizza Perfecttta box and some leftover pizza littered on the ground.

There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, \"Excitingly flavored!\" Personally, I wasn\'t having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn\'t have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them.

'They claimed on their website that they have \"the best wings in town\". As a seeker of good wings, let me tell you about my adventure with this place. \n\nEverything started fine with our order of 24 wings with three separate sauces for 3 eaters. The wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery. Here\'s the catch...THERE WAS NO SAUCE! My party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain. They were, I kid you not, so bland that I wasn\'t sure what I was eating. They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us. So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were, we called and complained about the sauce. About 40 minutes later, the sauce arrived. At this point, the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan and Spicy. The sauces were just average. The spicy sauce was so weak that I should\'ve just settled with a bottle of sirracha. \n\nThe deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get the point. But this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was. The outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little. It looked nice, but didn\'t taste that great. \n\nSo after 1 hour and 40 minutes, 24 wings, 3 sauces and a cannoli... we have 3 very unhappy customers.

'To be fair, this place deserves a 5 star review if it were for their veterinary care alone. They are highly knowledgeable and gave my pet nothing but the best while we were there. They also provide pheromone bandanas for the pets to help ease their anxiety while you wait, which I found extremely helpful.\n\nHowever, I was unable to be a loyal customer to this clinic as they were not loyal to me. It seemed every time I needed an appointment, they were fully booked for the next 2, sometimes 3 weeks. While I understand planning ahead for routine care like vaccines can be planned ahead, if my dog is experiencing an acute problem such as vomiting/diarrhea for a couple of days it\'s not worth anything if she can\'t be seen within a day or two. Their earliest appointment on that occasion was 1.5 weeks out. While this was frustrating and I was ready to switch vets, they redeemed themselves and kept me as a customer for a bit longer. I took my dog to the humane society to save some money on her shots and she ended up getting pretty sick. She kept vomiting and was lethargic, didn\'t want to eat or drink. I called the vet at the first sign of lethargic, loss of eating and drinking. They told me to bring her right in, no appointment necessary. They saw her as soon as we walked in and got us squared away with the proper medications and what to do next time before her shots to prevent her getting so sick again. I do appreciate them for that as they went above and beyond in that situation.\n\nThe point at which I decided to transfer to another vet is when we adopted a 2nd puppy from St. Louis. We got her from a shelter and she came to us with one leg amputated (fresh incision) and she would cry out in pain any time she was lifted or touched even close to that area, she also had a lot of diarrhea. The shelter we got her from gives a 2 week health guarantee but given the issues we wanted to be seen that week. I called for an appointment and was told the earliest was 2.5 weeks out. I explained the situation regarding her health concerns as well as the fact that we needed her to be seen within 2 weeks and asked if there was anything I could do. The receptionist responded by telling me I might consider having her seen by another vet or the humane society for the first time, & then have her first puppy appointment with them to continue her care from there. I\'m sorry but the purpose of having a vet is to have them as their primary doctor for health issues, so it\'s really a problem if we can\'t ever get an appointment and it\'s clear to me they don\'t want my dogs as their patients if they are suggesting for me to go somewhere else...but anyway I called the Big Easy in Lawrenceville right after I hung up since they couldn\'t even try to accommodate us, they got me in for a walk in appointment the same day and both of my dogs have been going there ever since.', negative, 1, 0

I wanted to like this place, so I\'ll start with the positive aspects.  \n\nFirst of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. \n\nIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. \n\n\nNow the downsides.  The staff wasn\'t very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn\'t allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It\'s poor form. \n\nThe ropes aren\'t doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren\'t rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. \n\nThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it\'s dangerous.  \n\nThere\'s only once changing room, and overall the place isn\'t very clean.  I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.', negative, 2, 0

We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\n\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn\'t try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband\'s chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. \n\nI might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere.', negative, 1, 0
'This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \"chicken maputo\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\".  Does the average diner know what \"maputo\" and \"piri piri\" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1\% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.', negative, 1, 0
'Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.\n\nFor appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.\n\nEntrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked.', negative, 0, 0
'Underwhelmed!! Very pricey food, cash only, average food. This is the first time I\'ve been here and really have no reason to go back. To be fair, what they put in your food is quality stuff: the lamb and duck we had are nice pieces of meat, but they are not made into the type of dishes you\'d expect for something worth ~$25 a piece.

'And so....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don\'t get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. \n\nNow what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn\'t what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn\'t bowled over by my stylist\'s professionalism either. Don\'t diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don\'t do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I\'ve been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. \"But,\" I said, \"the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist.\" \"Oh,\" the chick at the counter said, \"that\'s for Men\'s cuts.\" Silly me. \n\nSo when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN\'s haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, \"Oh, our stylist\'s charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.\" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. \"Oh, well.....I\'ll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number.\" Didn\'t she have my slip with the card number? \"Sorry, I don\'t give my credit card number over the phone.\" \"Or I can send you a gift certificate.\" \"Nope,\" I said through clenched teeth, \"I won\'t be coming back.\"\n\nIt wasn\'t the cut.

'I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don\'t notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn\'t hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.

'I was thrilled to finally find a yelp review with 4 stars and only one dollar sign on Yelp in the South Hills. Moving from LA recently where for some reason EVERYTHING is more expensive... except nail salons! Now, I am by no means, a spa rat but I do like to pamper the toes every now and again. So one afternoon when I had some spare time, I gave them a try. I was totally underwhelmed. From nail polish in the front with dust on it (how long have they been there?) To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor impressed. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn\'t been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail. A week later I had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure. This place doesn\'t feel clean or inviting. The decor was junkie and old and cluttered. I will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when I walked in. I was really pulling for you, Future Nails.

I did all the heavy lifting and got a quote to just fix the line.  which consisted of cutting the 8\" common later line,  Install a Y fitting and then tie that back into my 4\" line.    I thought maybe a days worth of work and a couple hundred dollars worth of fitting.   The problem is that I have no toilet or running water until this gets fixed and they could see that.   The quote was $2600 dollars.  I asked them to explain the high cost and they estimated 2 people for 2 days and said the fitting were really expensive.   I said I would get back to them.   back in the hole I go to stubbed in a temporary line on my own to get by for a couple days and then called a bunch of plumbers to get quotes.

Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \n\nI wasn\'t quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \"hated\" that jacket and that the liner was \"nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\" Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a \'96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I\'m not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style.

'My sister and I used to love going to Anthony\'s Pizza. It was a staple of Carrick for over 40 years. Recently it changed ownership and sadly the results are horrific.\n\nWe ordered an 8-cut (medium) pizza with anchovies. The problem is quantitative. They appear to be using the original recipe however the amount of dough, cheese, and sauce is literally 40\% or less of what it used to be. Anthony\'s always had a thin crusted pizza, but this is now paper thin! I\'ve been making pizza for years and have been to all the best pizza restaurants in Pittsburgh as a lifelong resident so I know good pizza and what is expected in terms of sizing. One piece was so small it literally fit within the palm of my hand (fingers excluded!) - we were shocked. To compound the misery, when my sister called to explain, she was not rude - polite, yet honest and firm, the woman who is co-owner was condescending and sarcastic and asked how she thought the pizza could be made better! My sister then calmly explained how the amount of dough and cheese used was less than half of what it should have been for a medium sized pizza. \n\nThe worst thing, and this really reflects on the woman\'s character and business ethics, is that not once did she offer an apology! Not even a simple \"I\'m sorry.\" That is outrageous and inexcusable. This was no small inconsequential complaint, it was a serious issue, yet it didn\'t even phase her. Also she didn\'t offer us a refund, she didn\'t offer to remake the pizza, nor did she offer us any sort of discount on future purchases. Needless to say we will never go there again. It\'s a shame because Anthony\'s used to have great pizza (I reviewed it when it was under the old ownership.) and we could have been loyal customers for years to come. Oh I should also note that the woman\'s 15/16 year old son, who looks like he has no experience cooking, is the cook! Even still she watched him make the pizza and she herself closed the box and handed it to me so she can\'t claim ignorance - on the phone she was incredulous. \n\nAlso the ambiance of Anthony\'s is not the same. They removed the venerable booths and replaced them with tables, took down the folk art collage on the main wall and no longer offer IBC soda. If they keep up these ridiculously small portions I can\'t see them staying in business very long. This is Carrick, not Sewickley or Mt. Lebanon.

'Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I\'ve somehow managed to never eat at Max\'s Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn\'t quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \"what\'s going on here\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max\'s does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \"Uh-oh\".  The menu is huge with a number of \"slow-food\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn\'t even half-full?  Answer: They can\'t.  The food isn\'t fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max\'s Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn\'t pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn\'t happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \"bacon\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \"meat\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn\'t have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn\'t taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax\'s Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\".\n\nThat\'s total bullshit.  It\'s awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI\'ll never return.', negative, 4, 1

'Let me preface this by saying that my understanding of goulash came from what my mom called goulash.  Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can\'t believe everything your parents tell you right?  \n\nSo going in here, I was thinking, great...mom\'s goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn\'t scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn\'t like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like \"world famous\" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  \n\nWhat I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  \n\nWould I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn\'t suggest it nor would I go on my own.  Oh well, on to the next one right?', negative, 5, 2
'I was highly disappointed. I heard rave reviews about the food but it was no where near as good as it was made out to be. I got the yagersnitzel. While the sauce was excellent, the veal was very hard to cut with a knife. It was also not pounded evenly and raw on the thick end. The spatzel was soggy, mushy and not drained properly. It was swimming in water. The rolls must have been refrigerated and were ice cold. The relish and apple butter were great however.  I also do have to say the German potato salad was dynamite. \n\nWe also ordered a spicy bloody mary and were given what tasted like watered down bloody mary mix  and vodka with nothing else in it. It was bad...the you can\'t drink it kind of bad. We had to spice them up ourselves with Worcestershire and Tabasco plus add salt and pepper to get them to taste OK. \n\nI will note their servers were excellent. I have no complaints at all about the service!\n\nMy husband has eaten there before and was sorely disappointed as well. I don\'t know if it was a bad day, but I\'d be weary of spending another $75 for lunch for 3 people and getting sub par food and a bar that can\'t pull off a basic drink.

'Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that I,m not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor, just an average consumer that lives on the Northside .\n         When will I ever learn. I really want to like this place. It\'s a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it\'s supposed to taste like and this isn\'t it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn\'t a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don\'t even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don\'t like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.\n\nSunday brunch\nA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum.

We were escorted to the rear of the tavern, which is covered in B&W pictures from the 40\'s, which gives it a old world tired feeling.\n\nThe menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant. I had Max\'s Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay.

Don\'t believe me?  I hope you enjoy tepid knackwurst and cold mashed potatoes.\n\nBTW, to whoever makes their mashed potatoes, you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them.  Yesterday they were undercooked, gritty, and gross.\n\nIn fact, all of the food is becoming gross.  My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it.  wtf was that????\n\nI\'m done.  This place has gone down hill.  You need a new chef, immediately.

Then, they didn\'t even do anything to make it up to me.  The brunch was also very sub-standard; everything was cold.  Not even the potato pancakes tasted good.  I\'ve had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the Holiday Inn.  But perhaps part of the meal was also tainted by the fact that I couldn\'t get the thought of their negligence for food contamination out of my head.

'I really wanted to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful.\n\nWe found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn\'t anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.\n\nI slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn\'t be this way. If this is personalized service, I\'d rather stay at a motel.\n\nEven without grumpy old man, there\'s nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.\n\nFor the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park.

'We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  \n\nThen we were put into a \"historical\" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  \n\nI find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50\% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \"historical\" creepy room.  \n\nFinally, a regular room-- the \"renovated\" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don\'t know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? \n\nI slept well in the \"new\" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. \n\nThe hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  \n\nI don\'t think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  I will spend more next time.\n\nBreakfast was \"eh\".

The next time I am in Pittsburgh it will not include a stay at The Priory, which is a shame because besides this issue it is a nice place.

'We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it\'s not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn\'t give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he\'ll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn\'t the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.

'My wife and I are seasoned travelers and have had many opportunities to enjoy hospitality all over the world, and we had high hopes for the Priory based on reviews, but the short version of our review is that we won\'t go back!

The worst however was the room itself (124) - odd stains in the tub that inhibited its use, a bathroom door that would not close completely preventing privacy, and an air conditioner that could double as a white noise machine.  Add to that a breakfast that was so lame that we didn\'t even bother with it the second morning - stale rolls, hard boiled eggs, unripened fruit, and not one thing served hot - just ridiculous for the price charged.

'I ordered lunch from Ron\'s Pizza Palace after a staff member of theirs visited my work\'s building to promote Ron\'s to nearby businesses. The staff member gave us all a menu and mentioned a discount we could use for the day, so my coworkers and I figured we\'d give them a try. And...I was pretty underwhelmed. \n\nFor starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I\'d gotten that info when I ordered. But what in the world did he plan on doing if I hadn\'t calculated my payment in advance? Would I have had to call in to sort out their staff\'s mistake? Would I have just handed the guy a random amount of money and waved him off? I have no idea.\n\nAnd the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired. I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn\'t rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. \n\nAs for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn\'t even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich\'s bread shouldn\'t break off when I bite into it, but that\'s what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.\n\nI currently don\'t plan on ordering from this place again. This is a prime example of \"you get what you pay for\" - and personally I\'d prefer to spend a couple extra dollars for a tastier and more satisfying lunch.', negative, 1, 0
'I really don\'t know how this place got any good reviews. One big problem is that the place is dirty, the carpets, the lighting above the tables and the furniture.

This I thought might have been a stomach flu so I did try this place again. The 2nd time I was with some friends from the neighborhood and 3/5 of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoning.Now I\'m thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat. I was going to stay away from the place but a friend from Troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home. No problem,next time I got french fries with gravy. How could this be a problem?.When they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my fries.When I told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava. Needless to say I refused to pay for them. The 4th time my friend dragged me there, I had a salad.

It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...\"oh that place? they basically just fry eggs\".\n\nOn top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler\'s rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).\n\nIn sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you\'re going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read).', negative, 0, 0
'At this point, I am done. I scheduled my kids for the last 2 weeks in August and then due to an emergency, I had to cancel, which I did a month before their camp was to start. I was told they were issuing my refund, and that was 3 weeks ago. THREE WEEKS and i still dont have it. I live probably 30 minutes from the museum and could have driven there 63838484848485858 times by now and picked it up. Its just sooo unprofessional and annoying. They need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner. 7-10 business days are fine but 3 WEEKS is UNACCEPTABLE for it to not have even been MAILED YET. So dissapointed and will never use them again.', negative, 0, 0
'In response to the response I received from the Museum rep, I called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet, but you reponded on Yelp. This week is the 3rd week. your response stated that my refund was sent this week, if you are speaking about this current week, today is the 14th, monday and the week has just begun. If you are talking about last week, can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on Yelp. Thank you.', negative, 0, 0

'After reading all of these horrible reviews, I made the mistake of still ordering from this place.  Order placed at 6:12 pm, delivered at 7:36pm.  Order was:\n\n1.  Cold\n2.  Ordered 2 medium pizzas, both THIN crust, one pepperoni, one premium salami...I received both regular crust one with sausage.\n\nCalled store, told Mgr. the problem he said, and I quote \" the problem is our driver took the wrong pizzas\"  no shit genius.

'OK, so based off the recommendation of my date, I thought  that I would like Legends North Shore but I left dinner disappointed and in need of a mint to mask the over abundance of garlic (salt) that I had consumed.\n\nThis restaurant is in a prime location on the North Side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area. That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses:\n\nBeans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don\'t think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don\'t get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish.\n\nBlackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded.\n\nThe restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence.  Unfortunately, Legends just didn\'t do it for me.\n\nWould I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try.', negative, 3, 1
'Its okay, but it was just ok.  \n\nThere\'s a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard.  We were expecting that would be for the table.\n\nWe started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.\n\nThey give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I\'m not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.\n\nMy friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.\n\nOverall I would come here again but maybe I\'d stick with a staple like chicken parmigana.', negative, 1, 1
'Watch out for the cold table in the pit In spite of requesting a move, we were told all tables were booked.Of course that was not true.

'If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I\'ve never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant!\nTheir food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant, go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back.', negative, 1, 0
'Went for the first and last time tonight. Made reservations for 3. Restaurant thought we said 2 and acted like we lied. $12 corkage fee for 1 bottle of wine. Asked to leave when we finished eating, because they needed the table, on a Thursday night. Food was OK, but not even close to making up for all the other problems. I can easily get a good meal elsewhere for those prices, with better service.', negative, 0, 0
'Legends is a an old style American-Italian restaurant. The restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers. People who came in with reservations waited for at least 20 minutes to get seated to their tables. Other people who walked-in were seated immediately if they promise \"to eat in less than an hour\" I guess they have reservations for other people for the same table but they want to get customers anyway. I was able to witness all of that because I was seated on the bar table which has the cashier/host. The food was less than average. I tried 3 different orders + desserts, nothing was impressing.', negative, 2, 1
'First time here. My parents raved about this place and how great the spots are. \n\nWe arrived at 6:45 in a sat night and were promptly seated at our table.\n\nWe ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began. They brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks. But this was quickly corrected. \n\nThey were fair. We had the Brussel sprouts which were under cooked and did not have any Parmesan cheese on them. Plus they were mixed in with large random pieces of lettuce. So odd! \n\nI was actually looking forward to the special. Ribeye topped with shrimp. But unfortunately they had already sold out of the special. Amazing since it was so early on in the night and nothing else in the menu looked good. It was all traditional oily foods. \n\nPlus who can\'t make a veal or chick parm. It\'s the easiest thing to make. \n\nMy parents had the spots and the portion was sooooo small and came on an plate all by itself. I give them a 1 for presentation. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the wine. Oh yeah it was byob. So I guess I did a good job at picking out the wine. Haha. \n\nService was nice and friendly. And she did apologize multiple times about the food. But did nothing to make up for it. \n\nWon\'t be back anytime soon.', negative, 0, 0
'Good food, nothing too \"amazing\", a bit overpriced for what they offer, but a good little quaint place to eat. Salad looked very nice, although they were stingy on the dressing, also only have 2 kind of dressings; Balsamic and ranch. Soups could have been a bit more full in the cups. I had the fettuccine Alfredo, and it was in all honesty an average meal of fettuccine, wasn\'t too impressed with it. But hey, if you\'re looking to try something new and don\'t mind spending a few extra bucks, give it a try!', negative, 0, 0
'The best thing about this place is Sam. The worst thing about this place is also Sam.\n\nWhat was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, \"You look oriental, but you also look American.\" I\'m pretty sure he wasn\'t meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn\'t know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.\n\nThis is not why I recommend against Caruso\'s, however. The reason why I\'ll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.\n\nI was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, \"Why don\'t you try this instead,\" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.\n\nSince the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam\'s recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That\'s when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its \"sell by\" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn\'t been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn\'t going to visit again anyway.\n\nStale beer aside, there\'s another big reason not to go to Caruso\'s: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella\'s, at least I know that Pistella\'s has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won\'t purposely sell me something that\'s not fresh.', negative, 1, 1
'The most dysfunctional subway I have ever been to.  I am in outside sales and eat at subway at least once a week throughout the pittsburgh area and surrounding.\n\nI ordered a Tuscan chicken salad and you would have thought I asked them to paint the sisteen chapel!  The fountain drinks are cheapened by less syrup and more soda water.  The sweet tea is also cheapened with hardly any sugar.\n\nThe only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here.  She is very polite even when asking a peer for help with ringing up my order.  The peer got all up in arms about how they never trained them to do that.  The young girl politely asked for a moment, sought out who I believe to be the owner/manager and came back promptly with a solution.\n\nI don\'t expect much from subway to begin with and this location is a far cry from bare minimum.', negative, 1, 0

'This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I\'ve ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot.

'Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience in my life. Hubby and I pulled in only to see a few cars down, people selling who-knows-what out of their car trunk. Also this is the only Giant Eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). Then we leave by waiting for a really dazed/swaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) on our way out of the parking lot. We are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again.', negative, 1, 1
'The store reeks of rotting fish, the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I\'ve seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.\n\nOne plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don\'t have a car. \"Need a car\" haha some things about living in the hood just never change. \n\nWith this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it\'s been years and still no change.', negative, 3, 0
